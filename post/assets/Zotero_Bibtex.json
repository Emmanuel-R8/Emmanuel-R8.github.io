      "abstractNote": "Ability of deep networks to extract high level features and of recurrent networks to perform time-series inference have been studied. In view of universality of one hidden layer network at approximating functions under weak constraints, the benefit of multiple layers is to enlarge the space of dynamical systems approximated or, given the space, reduce the number of units required for a certain error. Traditionally shallow networks with manually engineered features are used, back-propagation extent is limited to one and attempt to choose a large number of hidden units to satisfy the Markov condition is made. In case of Markov models, it has been shown that many systems need to be modeled as higher order. In the present work, we present deep recurrent networks with longer backpropagation through time extent as a solution to modeling systems that are high order and to predicting ahead. We study epileptic seizure suppression electro-stimulator. Extraction of manually engineered complex features and prediction employing them has not allowed small low-power implementations as, to avoid possibility of surgery, extraction of any features that may be required has to be included. In this solution, a recurrent neural network performs both feature extraction and prediction. We prove analytically that adding hidden layers or increasing backpropagation extent increases the rate of decrease of approximation error. A Dynamic Programming (DP) training procedure employing matrix operations is derived. DP and use of matrix operations makes the procedure efficient particularly when using data-parallel computing. The simulation studies show the geometry of the parameter space, that the network learns the temporal structure, that parameters converge while model output displays same dynamic behavior as the system and greater than .99 Average Detection Rate on all real seizure data tried.",

The increase in computational power and the development of faster learning algorithms have made them applicable to relevant machine learning problems. They attracted much attention recently after being proposed as building blocks of multi-layer learning systems called deep belief networks. This tutorial introduces RBMs as undirected graphical models. The basic concepts of graphical models are introduced ﬁrst, however, basic knowledge in statistics is presumed. Diﬀerent learning algorithms for RBMs are discussed. As most of them are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, an introduction to Markov chains and the required MCMC techniques is provided.",

Modiﬁed VaR has been widely implemented as a portfolio selection criterion. We are the ﬁrst to investigate hedge fund portfolio selection using modiﬁed ES as optimality criterion. We show that for the EDHEC hedge fund style indices, the optimal portfolios based on modiﬁed ES outperform out-of-sample the EDHEC Fund of Funds index and have better risk characteristics than the equal-weighted and Fund of Funds portfolios.",

      "abstractNote": "Several data mining algorithms use iterative optimization methods for learning predictive models. It is not easy to determine upfront which optimization method will perform best or converge fast for such tasks. In this paper, we analyze Meta Algorithms (MAs) which work by adaptively combining iterates from a pool of base optimization algorithms. We show that the performance of MAs are competitive with the best convex combination of the iterates from the base algorithms for online as well as batch convex optimization problems. We illustrate the effectiveness of MAs on the problem of portfolio selection in the stock market and use several existing ideas for portfolio selection as base algorithms. Using daily S&P500 data for the past 21 years and a benchmark NYSE dataset, we show that MAs outperform existing portfolio selection algorithms with provable guarantees by several orders of magnitude, and match the performance of the best heuristics in the pool.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent papers have demonstrated that both predicate invention and the learning of recursion can be eﬃciently implemented by way of abduction with respect to a meta-interpreter. This paper shows how Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) can be extended to implement a Bayesian posterior distribution over the hypothesis space by treating the meta-interpreter as a Stochastic Logic Program. The resulting M etaBayes system uses stochastic reﬁnement to randomly sample consistent hypotheses which are used to approximate Bayes’ Prediction. Most approaches to Statistical Relational Learning involve separate phases of model estimation and parameter estimation. We show how a variant of the MetaBayes approach can be used to carry out simultaneous model and parameter estimation for a new representation we refer to as a Super-imposed Logic Program (SiLPs). The implementation of this approach is referred to as M etaBayesSiLP . SiLPs are a particular form of ProbLog program, and so the parameters can also be estimated using the more traditional EM approach employed by ProbLog. This second approach is implemented in a new system called M ilP robLog. Experiments are conducted on learning grammars, family relations and a natural language domain. These demonstrate that M etaBayes outperforms M etaBayesMAP in terms of predictive accuracy and also outperforms both M ilP robLog and M etaBayesSiLP on log likelihood measures. However, M etaBayes incurs substantially higher running times than M etaBayesMAP . On the other hand, M etaBayes and M etaBayesSiLP have similar running times while both have much shorter running times than M ilP robLog.",

      "abstractNote": "Phanagoria – the largest known ancient Greek settlement on the territory of Russia is situated on the Taman peninsula on the southern side of the Taman bay. The unique feature of the site is that about 1/3 of the settlement of Phanagoria is currently flooded by waters of the Taman bay due to the transgression of the Black sea level since antiquity. In 2012 in the course of underwater prospection of the Taman bay a wooden ship buried under the 1.5 m thick bottom sediments was discovered in situ. The unique feature of the ship is excellent preservation of its wooden parts, which makes it one of the few finds of this kind ever made on the territory of Russia. This paper presents a case-study of application of photogrammetry technique for archaeological field documentation record in course of underwater excavations of the Phanagorian shipwreck. The advantages and possible underwaterspecific constraints of automated point cloud extraction algorithm which was used in the research are discussed. The paper gives an overview of the practical aspects of the workflow of photgrammetry technique application at the excavation ground: photo capture procedure and measurement of control points. Finally a resulting 3-D model of the shipwreck is presented and high potential of automated point cloud extraction algorithms for archaeological documentation record is concluded.",

Many of the researchers analyses the Bridge bidding and playing phases, and they developed many programs for getting better results. The programs were performing well and it is also matter of time before the computer beats most human bridge players. As such, the researchers mainly focused on the techniques and computer programs which were used in bridge bidding and playing phases.",

Randomized search methods such as stochastic clause selection (SCS) and rapid random restarts (RRR) have proven somewhat successful at addressing this weakness. However, on datasets where hypothesis evaluation is computationally expensive, even these algorithms may take unreasonably long to discover a good solution. We attempt to improve the performance of these algorithms on datasets by learning an approximation to ILP hypothesis evaluation. We generate a small set of hypotheses, uniformly sampled from the space of candidate hypotheses, and evaluate this set on actual data. These hypotheses and their corresponding evaluation scores serve as training data for learning an approximate hypothesis evaluator. We outline three techniques that make use of the trained evaluation-function approximator in order to reduce the computation required during an ILP hypothesis search. We test our approximate clause evaluation algorithm using the popular ILP system Aleph. Empirical results are provided on several benchmark datasets. We show that the clause evaluation function can be accurately approximated.",

In this paper we investigate whether deep convolutional networks can be used to directly represent and learn this knowledge. We train a large 12-layer convolutional neural network by supervised learning from a database of human professional games. The network correctly predicts the expert move in 55% of positions, equalling the accuracy of a 6 dan human player. When the trained convolutional network was used directly to play games of Go, without any search, it beat the traditional-search program GnuGo in 97% of games, and matched the performance of a state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo tree search that simulates two million positions per move.",

The individual ts may be from subset linear regression, ridge regression, or something more complex like a neural network. We develop a general framework for this problem and examine a recent cross-validation-based proposal called \\stacking\" in this context. Combination methods based on the bootstrap and analytic methods are also derived and compared in a number of examples, including best subsets regression and regression trees. Finally, we apply these ideas to classi cation problems where the estimated combination weights can yield insight into the structure of the problem.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper examines high dimensional regression with noise-contaminated input and output data. Goals of such learning problems include optimal prediction with noiseless query points and optimal system identiﬁcation. As a ﬁrst step, we focus on linear regression methods, since these can be easily cast into nonlinear learning problems with locally weighted learning approaches. Standard linear regression algorithms generate biased regression estimates if input noise is present and suﬀer numerically when the data contains redundancy and irrelevancy. Inspired by Factor Analysis Regression, we develop a variational Bayesian algorithm that is robust to ill-conditioned data, automatically detects relevant features, and identiﬁes input and output noise – all in a computationally eﬃcient way. We demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our techniques on synthetic data and on a system identiﬁcation task for a rigid body dynamics model of a robotic vision head. Our algorithm performs 10 to 70% better than previously suggested methods.",

We show how short sales change the trading rule which now acts as a dynamic trailing ‘stop-and-reverse’, instead of a dynamic trailing stop as in the context of ‘long-only’ trades. Then we empirically examine the performance of our modiﬁcation in the context of a ‘long/short’ trading approach and discuss the diﬀerentiation and implications in strategy performance. We compare both the modiﬁed version of our trading rule with the standard moving average approach and also compare the long/short approach with the long-only approach of the earlier paper.",

A simple moving average timing model is tested since 1900 on the United States equity market before testing since 1973 on other diverse and publicly traded asset class indices, including the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE Index (MSCI EAFE), Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI), National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Index (NAREIT), and United States government 10-year Treasury bonds. The approach is then examined in a tactical asset allocation framework where the empirical results are equity-like returns with bond-like volatility and drawdown.",

While traditional expert advice and “universal” algorithms (as well as standard technical trading heuristics) attempt to predict winners or trends, our approach relies on predictable statistical relations between all pairs of stocks in the market. Our empirical results on historical markets provide strong evidence that this type of technical trading can “beat the market” and moreover, can beat the best stock in the market. In doing so we utilize a new idea for smoothing critical parameters in the context of expert learning.",

      "abstractNote": "It is widely believed that correlations between international equity markets tend to increase in highly volatile bear markets. This has led some to doubt the benefits of international diversification. This article solves the dynamic portfolio choice problem of a US investor faced with a time-varying investment opportunity set which may be characterized by correlations and volatilities that increase in bad times. We model the state dependance of US, UK, and German equity returns using a regime-switching model and find evidence for the existence of a high volatility regime, in which returns are more highly correlated and have lower means. Solving the dynamic asset allocation problem for a CCRA investor, we show international diversification is still valuable with regime changes. Currency hedging imparts further benefit. The costs of ignoring the regimes are small for moderate levels of risk aversion, and the intertemporal hedging demands induced by time-varying correlations are negligible.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent progress on probabilistic modeling and statistical learning, coupled with the availability of large training datasets, has led to remarkable progress in computer vision. Generative probabilistic models, or “analysis-by-synthesis” approaches, can capture rich scene structure but have been less widely applied than their discriminative counterparts, as they often require considerable problem-speciﬁc engineering in modeling and inference, and inference is typically seen as requiring slow, hypothesize-and-test Monte Carlo methods. Here we present Picture, a probabilistic programming language for scene understanding that allows researchers to express complex generative vision models, while automatically solving them using fast general-purpose inference machinery. Picture provides a stochastic scene language that can express generative models for arbitrary 2D/3D scenes, as well as a hierarchy of representation layers for comparing scene hypotheses with observed images by matching not simply pixels, but also more abstract features (e.g., contours, deep neural network activations). Inference can ﬂexibly integrate advanced Monte Carlo strategies with fast bottomup data-driven methods. Thus both representations and inference strategies can build directly on progress in discriminatively trained systems to make generative vision more robust and efﬁcient. We use Picture to write programs for 3D face analysis, 3D human pose estimation, and 3D object reconstruction – each competitive with specially engineered baselines.",

Machine reading systems can be tested on their ability to answer questions posed on the contents of documents that they have seen, but until now large scale training and test datasets have been missing for this type of evaluation. In this work we deﬁne a new methodology that resolves this bottleneck and provides large scale supervised reading comprehension data. This allows us to develop a class of attention based deep neural networks that learn to read real documents and answer complex questions with minimal prior knowledge of language structure.",

      "abstractNote": "Many real world domains require the representation of a measure of uncertainty. The most common such representation is probability, and the combination of probability with logic programs has given rise to the ﬁeld of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP), leading to languages such as the Independent Choice Logic, Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs), Problog, PRISM and others. These languages share a similar distribution semantics, and methods have been devised to translate programs between these languages. The complexity of computing the probability of queries to these general PLP programs is very high due to the need to combine the probabilities of explanations that may not be exclusive. As one alternative, the PRISM system reduces the complexity of query answering by restricting the form of programs it can evaluate. As an entirely diﬀerent alternative, Possibilistic Logic Programs adopt a simpler metric of uncertainty than probability.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper we argue that bidding in the game of Contract Bridge can pro tably be regarded as a micro-world suitable for experimenting with pragmatics. We sketch an analysis in which a \\bidding system\" is treated as the semantics of an arti cial language, and show how this \\language\", despite its apparent simplicity, is capable of supporting a wide variety of common speech acts parallel to those in natural languages; we also argue that the reason for the relatively unsuccessful nature of previous attempts to write strong Bridge playing programs has been their failure to address the need to reason explicitly about knowledge, pragmatics, probabilities and plans. We give an overview of Pragma, a system currently under development, which embodies these ideas in concrete form, using a combination of rule-based inference, stochastic simulation, and \\neural-net\" learning. Examples are given illustrating the functionality of the system in its current form.",

This architecture uses four main components: parallel actors that generate new behaviour; parallel learners that are trained from stored experience; a distributed neural network to represent the value function or behaviour policy; and a distributed store of experience. We used our architecture to implement the Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2013). Our distributed algorithm was applied to 49 games from Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, using identical hyperparameters. Our performance surpassed non-distributed DQN in 41 of the 49 games and also reduced the wall-time required to achieve these results by an order of magnitude on most games.",

      "abstractNote": "Institutional fund managers generally rebalance using ad hoc methods such as calendar basis or tolerance band triggers. We propose a different framework that quantiﬁes the cost of a rebalancing strategy in terms of risk-adjusted returns net of transaction costs. We then develop an optimal rebalancing strategy that actively seeks to minimize that cost. We use certainty equivalents and the transaction costs associated with a policy to deﬁne a cost-to-go function, and we minimize this expected cost-to-go using dynamic programming. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional rebalancing strategies like monthly, quarterly, annual, and 5% tolerance rebalancing. We also show the robustness of our method to model error by performing sensitivity analyses.",

In line with existing measures, developed speciﬁcally to capture that alpha (Rebalancing Bonus), we show that high volatility as well as low correlation maximize the magnitude of the excess return. However, in contrast to previous works, we demonstrate that the actual driver and therefore suﬃcient condition for a Rebalancing Bonus is the presence of relative mean-reversion. All results in the present note are supported via numerical simulations and a case study on global equities.",

      "abstractNote": "In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ‘cobordism’: a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum ﬁeld theory and ‘quantum topology’. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of ‘closed symmetric monoidal category’. We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.",

We propose a different framework that quantiﬁes the cost of a rebalancing strategy in terms of risk-adjusted returns net of transaction costs. We then develop an optimal rebalancing strategy that actively seeks to minimize that cost. We use certainty equivalents and the transaction costs associated with a policy to deﬁne a cost-to-go function, and we minimize this expected cost-to-go using dynamic programming. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional rebalancing strategies like monthly, quarterly, annual, and 5% tolerance rebalancing. We also show the robustness of our method to model error by performing sensitivity analyses.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper applies formal risk management methodologies to optimization of a portfolio of hedge funds (fund of funds). We compare recently developed risk management methodologies: Conditional Value-at-Risk and Conditional Drawdown-atRisk with more established Mean-Absolute Deviation, Maximum Loss, and Market Neutrality approaches. The common property of considered risk management techniques is that they admit the formulation of a portfolio optimization model as a linear programming (LP) problem. LP formulations allow for implementing efficient and robust portfo lio allocation algorithms, which can successfully handle optimization problems with thousands of instruments and scenarios. The performance of various risk constraints is investigated and discussed in detail for in-sample and out-of-sample testing of the algorithm. The numerical experiments show that imposing risk constraints may improve the “real” performance of a portfolio rebalancing strategy in out-of-sample runs. It is beneficial to combine several types of risk constraints that control different sources of risk.",

The selected investment instruments consist of the nine sector exchange traded funds (ETFs) that represent the U.S. stock market. The Bayesian information criterion is used to determine the optimal number of regimes. The investment objective is to dynamically maximize the portfolio alpha (excess return over the T-Bill) subject to neutralization of the portfolio sensitivities to the selected risk factors. The portfolio risk exposures are shown to change with various style and macro factors over time. The maximization problem in this context can be established as a regime-dependent linear programming problem. The optimal portfolio constructed as such is expected to outperform a naive benchmark strategy, which equally weights the ETFs. We evaluate the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of the regime-dependent market neutral strategy against the equally weighted strategy. We ﬁnd that the former generally outperforms the latter.",

Although the method can in principle be applied to any desired quantile, we will focus only on the 10th (B-Basis) in this study. We consider failure data arising from two sources: (1) a controlled environment where data is simulated from different Weibull distributions; (2) a supplied dataset similar to that of [3] augmented with failure load predictions from two additional analytical models (Model S2 and Model S3). Using absolute deviation between true and estimated 10th percentiles and the CVaR regression goodness-of-ﬁt measure introduced in [3] as accuracy-assessment criteria, the key ﬁndings are as follows. The accuracy of CVaR regression is relatively insensitive to the number of batches present, but fairly sensitive to the number of test points per batch3. There are diminishing beneﬁts in using more than 10 batches, or more than 10 test points per batch, in any one application of CVaR regression. The estimates of A-basis and B-basis are fairly robust, in the sense that they are not severely affected by miscalibrations (biases or errors) in the analytical models. Among the analytical models used as the sole input with no (input) test data, the best performer is Model S, followed by Model S2. Model S3 is the worst performer. The models contribute substantially to percentile prediction when up to 3 test points are used as input. When 4 test points are used as input, the 3 models can be roughly equated to the input information provided by one additional test point.",

The approach involves the linear combination of factors that are associated with failure load, into a statistical factor model. This model directly estimates percentiles of the failure load distribution (rather than mean values as in ordinary least squares regression). A regression framework with CVaR deviation as the measure of optimality, is used in constructing the estimates. We consider estimates of conﬁdence intervals for the estimates of percentiles, and adopt the most promising of these to compute A-Basis and B-Basis values. Numerical experiments with the available dataset show that the approach is quite robust, and can lead to a signiﬁcant savings in number of actual testings. The approach pools together information from earlier experiments and model runs, with new experiments and model predictions, resulting in accurate inferences even in the presence of relatively small datasets.",

The main purpose of the study is to examine the performance of a regime-based asset allocation strategy under realistic assumptions, compared to a buy and hold strategy. An empirical study, utilizing daily return series of major equity indices in the US, Japan, and Germany over the last 40 years, investigates the performance of the model. In an out-of-sample context, the strategy proves proﬁtable after taking transaction costs into account. For the regional markets under consideration, the volatility reduces on average by 41%. Additionally, annualized excess returns attain 18.5 to 201.6 basis points.",

Portfolio performance is measured in terms of four metrics: volatility, Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, and turnover. Our empirical evidence shows that using option-implied volatility helps to reduce portfolio volatility, but does not improve the Sharpe ratio or certaintyequivalent return; option-implied correlation does not improve any of the metrics; however, expected returns estimated using information in the volatility risk premium and option-implied skewness increase substantially both the Sharpe ratio and certainty-equivalent return, even after prohibiting shortsales and accounting for transactions costs.",

This methodology applies the entropy-based \"fully ﬂexible views\" approach in Meucci (2008) and a novel consistency algorithm to extend the Bayesian network approach in Rebonato (2010). Starting from a plausible market distribution of the drivers, we are able to stress any conditional probabilities. These conditional probabilities comprise, but are not restricted to, causal Bayesian networks. Furthermore, in our approach we can also stress-test expectations, volatilities, correlations, quantiles, medians, etc.",

      "abstractNote": "Disappointed with the performance of market weighted benchmark portfolios yet skeptical about the merits of active portfolio management, investors in recent years turned to alternative index definitions. Minimum variance investing is one of these popular rule driven, i.e. new passive concepts. I show in this paper theoretically and empirically that the portfolio construction process behind minimum variance investing implicitly picks up risk-based pricing anomalies. In other words the minimum variance tends to hold low beta and low residual risk stocks. Long/short portfolios based on these characteristics have been associated in the empirical literature with risk-adjusted outperformance (alpha). This paper shows that 83% of the variation of the minimum variance portfolio excess returns (relative to a capitalization weighted alternative) can be attributed to the FAMA/FRENCH factors as well as to the returns on two characteristic anomaly portfolios. All regression coefficients (factor exposures) are highly significant, stable over the estimation period and correspond remarkably well with our economic intuition.",

      "abstractNote": "Empirical studies document that equity portfolios constructed to have the lowest possible risk have surprisingly high average returns. We derive an analytic solution for the long-only minimum variance portfolio under the assumption of a single-factor covariance matrix. The equation for optimal security weights has a simple and intuitive form that provides several insights on minimum variance portfolio composition. While high idiosyncratic risk can lead to a low security weight, high systematic risk takes the large majority of investable securities out of long-only solutions. The relatively small set of securities that remain have market betas below an analytically specified threshold beta. The ratio of portfolio beta to the threshold beta dictates the portion of ex-ante portfolio variance that is market-factor related. We verify and illustrate the portfolio mathematics using historical data on the U.S. equity market and explore how the single-factor analytic results compare to numerical optimization under a generalized covariance matrix. The analytic and empirical results of this study suggest that minimum variance portfolio performance is largely a function of the long-standing empirical critique of the traditional CAPM that low beta stocks have relatively high average returns.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose a novel approach to active risk management based on the Basel II regulations to obtain optimal portfolios with minimum capital requirements. In order to avoid regulatory penalties due to an excessive number of value-at-risk (VaR) violations, capital requirements are minimized subject to a given number of violations over the previous trading year. An empirical application for three portfolios involving diﬀerent types of assets demonstrates that the proposed approach delivers an improved balance between capital requirement levels and the number of VaR exceedances. Furthermore, the risk-adjusted performance of the proposed approach is superior to that of minimum-VaR portfolios.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper proposes a new tractable approach to solving multi-period asset allocation problems. We assume that investor preferences are deÞned over moments of the terminal wealth distribution such as its skew and kurtosis. Time-variations in investment opportunities are driven by a regime switching process that can capture bull and bear states. We develop analytical methods that only require solving a small set of diﬀerence equations and thus are very convenient to use. These methods are applied to a simple portfolio selection problem involving choosing between a stock index and a risk-free asset in the presence of bull and bear states in the return distribution. If the market is in a bear state, investors increase allocations to stocks the longer their time horizon. Conversely, in bull markets it is optimal for investors to decrease allocations to stocks the longer their investment horizon.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently, a new approach for optimization of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) was suggested and tested with several applications. For continuous distributions, CVaR is deﬁned as the expected loss exceeding Value-at Risk (VaR). However, generally, CVaR is the weighted average of VaR and losses exceeding VaR. Central to the approach is an optimization technique for calculating VaR and optimizing CVaR simultaneously. This paper extends this approach to the optimization problems with CVaR constraints. In particular, the approach can be used for maximizing expected returns under CVaR constraints. Multiple CVaR constraints with various conﬁdence levels can be used to shape the proﬁt/loss distribution. A case study for the portfolio of S&P 100 stocks is performed to demonstrate how the new optimization techniques can be implemented.",

      "abstractNote": "In a dynamic context, portfolio management is a sequential process in which an investor revises his allocation periodically with respect to changing endogenous conditions and to the ongoing evolution on the ﬁnancial markets. In this paper, we present a stochastic multistage optimization model for the portfolio revision problem. We consider rebalancing activities, transaction costs, stochastic volatilities and many others. Furthermore, we introduce a general framework for the generation of the asset returns. The regime switching model proposed allows to capture fat tails, contagion, decoupling, volatility clustering and many other empirical properties of asset returns. Such a true dynamic approach to portfolio management leads to undisputable advantages in practical applications.",

      "abstractNote": "It is argued that the Weinberg-Salam model is the way it is because the most general selfconsistent eﬀective ﬁeld theory of massive vector bosons interacting with fermions and photons at leading order coincides with the Weinberg-Salam model in unitary gauge where the scalar ﬁeld is replaced by its vacuum expectation value. To support this argument the most general Lorentzinvariant eﬀective Lagrangian of massive vector bosons coupled to massless fermions is considered. Restrictions imposed on the interaction terms following from the consistency with the constraints of the second class and the perturbative renormalizability in the sense of eﬀective ﬁeld theories is analyzed. It is shown that the leading order eﬀective Lagrangian containing interaction terms with dimensionless coupling constants coincides with the leading order eﬀective Lagrangian of the locally invariant Yang-Mills theory up to globally invariant mass term of the vector bosons. Including the fermion masses and mixings and the interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld leads to an eﬀective ﬁeld theory which at leading order looks like as if it was an SU (2) × U (1) gauge invariant theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking in unitary gauge with the scalar ﬁeld replaced by its vacuum expectation value.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper studies strategic asset allocation and consumption choice in the presence of regime switching in asset returns. We ﬁnd evidence that four separate regimes - characterized as crash, slow growth, bull and recovery states - are required to capture the joint distribution of stock and bond returns. Optimal asset allocations vary considerably across these states - both among bonds and stocks and among large and small stocks - and change over time as investors revise their estimates of the underlying state probabilities. In the crash state investors always allocate more of their portfolio to stocks the longer their investment horizon, while the optimal allocation to stocks declines as a function of the investment horizon in bull markets. The joint eﬀects of learning about the underlying state probabilities and predictability of asset returns from the dividend yield give rise to a non-monotonic relationship between the investment horizon and the demand for stocks. Consumption-to-wealth ratios are found to depend on the underlying state and welfare costs from ignoring regime switching are substantial even after accounting for parameter uncertainty. Out-of-sample forecasting experiments conﬁrm the economic importance of accounting for the presence of regimes in asset returns.",

We account for nonnormally distributed, skewed, and leptokurtic asset return distributions due to regime shifts. The focus is on standard CRRA utility with a money back guarantee at maturity, which is often augmented to individual retirement plans. Optimal solutions for the unconstrained as well as the constrained policy are provided and examined for risk management costs calculated as welfare losses. Our results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that money back guarantees yield mild downside protection at low economic costs for most long term investors.",

      "abstractNote": "Contract bridge is an example of an incomplete information game for which computers typically do not perform better than expert human bridge players. In particular, the typical bidding decisions of human bridge players are difﬁcult to mimic with a computer program, and thus automatic bridge bidding remains to be a challenging research problem. Currently, the possibility of automatic bidding without mimicking human players has not been fully studied. In this work, we take an initiative to study such a possibility for the speciﬁc problem of bidding without competition. We propose a novel learning framework to let a computer program learn its own bidding decisions. The framework transforms the bidding problem into a learning problem, and then solves the problem with a carefully designed model that consists of cost-sensitive classiﬁers and upper-conﬁdence-bound algorithms. We validate the proposed model and ﬁnd that it performs competitively to the champion computer bridge program that mimics human bidding decisions.",

      "abstractNote": "Bridge is among the zero-sum games for which artiﬁcial intelligence has not yet outperformed expert human players. The main difﬁculty lies in the bidding phase of bridge, which requires cooperative decision making under partial information. Existing artiﬁcial intelligence systems for bridge bidding rely on and are thus restricted by human-designed bidding systems or features. In this work, we propose a pioneering bridge bidding system without the aid of human domain knowledge. The system is based on a novel deep reinforcement learning model, which extracts sophisticated features and learns to bid automatically based on raw card data. The model includes an upper-conﬁdence-bound algorithm and additional techniques to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Our experiments validate the promising performance of our proposed model. In particular, the model advances from having no knowledge about bidding to achieving superior performance when compared with a champion-winning computer bridge program that implements a human-designed bidding system.",

      "abstractNote": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks to bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract level, which makes it difﬁcult to implement high-level cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which veriﬁability is important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-ofconcept, we present a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system –though just a prototype – learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game.",

      "abstractNote": "Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-ofthe-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses O(n2) time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this ﬁnding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from O(n2) to O(n) in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the Linformer, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efﬁcient.",

      "abstractNote": "Large pre-trained neural networks such as BERT have had great recent success in NLP, motivating a growing body of research investigating what aspects of language they are able to learn from unlabeled data. Most recent analysis has focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal) or internal vector representations (e.g., probing classiﬁers). Complementary to these works, we propose methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT’s attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to delimiter tokens, speciﬁc positional offsets, or broadly attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we ﬁnd heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classiﬁer and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT’s attention.",

      "abstractNote": "Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a ﬁxed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a ﬁxed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, TransformerXL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-ofthe-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without ﬁnetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorﬂow and PyTorch1.",

      "abstractNote": "Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efﬁciency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O(L2) to O(L log L), where L is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of N times, where N is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efﬁcient and much faster on long sequences.",

However, the quadratic cost of attention and linear memory cost per layer have severely limited the transformer to operate solely on short sequences, a problem partially addressed by the reversible layers and LSH attention proposed in the reformer [3]. In this work, we study and improve properties of the reformer as a language model, introducing k-means clustering for attention and connection tying in reversible layers to improve reformer complexity and representational power. We evaluate our model on masked language modeling as well as selected GLUE benchmarks, and we ﬁnd that our modiﬁcations signiﬁcantly improve training times and model capacity. The methods presented in our work are generalizable to other attention-based models and have the potential to drastically improve the efﬁcacy of long-term language dependency modeling.",

      "abstractNote": "Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its eﬀectiveness, self-attention suﬀers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling ﬂexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the eﬃciency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.",

      "abstractNote": "There is a widespread need for techniques that can discover structure from time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to ﬁnd structure within a single time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of temporal patterns, it is diﬃcult to extend and can be brittle in practice. This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using abstract syntax trees for a domain-speciﬁc probabilistic language, and (ii) represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using probabilistic programs in a suﬃciently expressive language. The ﬁnal probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over both non-parametric and standard regression baselines.",

In particular, we distill probabilistic programming down to a single abstraction---the random variable. Our lightweight implementation in TensorFlow enables numerous applications: a model-parallel variational auto-encoder (VAE) with 2nd-generation tensor processing units (TPUv2s); a data-parallel autoregressive model (Image Transformer) with TPUv2s; and multi-GPU No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). For both a state-of-the-art VAE on 64x64 ImageNet and Image Transformer on 256x256 CelebA-HQ, our approach achieves an optimal linear speedup from 1 to 256 TPUv2 chips. With NUTS, we see a 100x speedup on GPUs over Stan and 37x over PyMC3.",

These techniques work with probabilistic domain-specific data modeling languages that capture key properties of a broad class of data generating processes, using Bayesian inference to synthesize probabilistic programs in these modeling languages given observed data. We provide a precise formulation of Bayesian synthesis for automatic data modeling that identifies sufficient conditions for the resulting synthesis procedure to be sound. We also derive a general class of synthesis algorithms for domain-specific languages specified by probabilistic context-free grammars and establish the soundness of our approach for these languages. We apply the techniques to automatically synthesize probabilistic programs for time series data and multivariate tabular data. We show how to analyze the structure of the synthesized programs to compute, for key qualitative properties of interest, the probability that the underlying data generating process exhibits each of these properties. Second, we translate probabilistic programs in the domain-specific language into probabilistic programs in Venture, a general-purpose probabilistic programming system. The translated Venture programs are then executed to obtain predictions of new time series data and new multivariate data records. Experimental results show that our techniques can accurately infer qualitative structure in multiple real-world data sets and outperform standard data analysis methods in forecasting and predicting new data.",

The method is appropriate for jointly modeling hundreds of time series with widely varying, non-stationary dynamics. Given a collection of N time series, the Bayesian model ﬁrst partitions them into independent clusters using a Chinese restaurant process prior. Within a cluster, all time series are modeled jointly using a novel “temporally-reweighted” extension of the Chinese restaurant process mixture. Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, which are then used to form predictive inferences. We apply the technique to challenging forecasting and imputation tasks using seasonal ﬂu data from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy and competitive imputation accuracy as compared to multiple widely used baselines. We further show that the model discovers interpretable clusters in datasets with hundreds of time series, using macroeconomic data from the Gapminder Foundation.",

Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high quality forecasts –especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines conﬁgurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically ﬂag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most eﬀectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series.",

      "abstractNote": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The self-attention architecture allows us to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations. However, all-to-all attention severely hurts the scaling of the model to large sequences. Another limitation is that information about the context is stored in the same element-wise representations. This makes the processing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difﬁcult. Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study two extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, and (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers on machine translation task and demonstrate that memory size positively correlates with the model performance. Attention patterns over the memory suggest that it improves the model’s ability to process a global context. We expect that the application of Memory Transformer architectures to the tasks of language modeling, reading comprehension, and text summarization, as well as other NLP tasks that require the processing of long contexts will contribute to solving challenging problems of natural language understanding and generation.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite being the workhorse of deep learning, the backpropagation algorithm is no panacea. It enforces sequential layer updates, thus preventing efﬁcient parallelization of the training process. Furthermore, its biological plausibility is being challenged. Alternative schemes have been devised; yet, under the constraint of synaptic asymmetry, none have scaled to modern deep learning tasks and architectures. Here, we challenge this perspective, and study the applicability of Direct Feedback Alignment to neural view synthesis, recommender systems, geometric learning, and natural language processing. In contrast with previous studies limited to computer vision tasks, our ﬁndings show that it successfully trains a large range of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, with performance close to ﬁne-tuned backpropagation. At variance with common beliefs, our work supports that challenging tasks can be tackled in the absence of weight transport.",

      "abstractNote": "While supervised learning has enabled great progress in many applications, unsupervised learning has not seen such widespread adoption, and remains an important and challenging endeavor for artiﬁcial intelligence. In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.",

One fundamental assumption is that convolutional kernels should be shared for all examples in a dataset. We propose conditionally parameterized convolutions (CondConv), which learn specialized convolutional kernels for each example. Replacing normal convolutions with CondConv enables us to increase the size and capacity of a network, while maintaining efﬁcient inference. We demonstrate that scaling networks with CondConv improves the performance and inference cost trade-off of several existing convolutional neural network architectures on both classiﬁcation and detection tasks. On ImageNet classiﬁcation, our CondConv approach applied to EfﬁcientNet-B0 achieves state-ofthe-art performance of 78.3% accuracy with only 413M multiply-adds.

DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs—both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classiﬁcation benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.",

      "abstractNote": "Arguably, unsupervised learning plays a crucial role in the majority of algorithms for processing brain imaging. A recently introduced unsupervised approach Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a promising tool for exploring brain structure in a ﬂexible non-linear way. In this paper, we investigate the use of variants of DIM in a setting of progression to Alzheimer’s disease in comparison with supervised AlexNet and ResNet inspired convolutional neural networks. As a benchmark, we use a classiﬁcation task between four groups: patients with stable, and progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with Alzheimer’s disease, and healthy controls. Our dataset is comprised of 828 subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our experiments highlight encouraging evidence of the high potential utility of DIM in future neuroimaging studies.",

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefﬁcient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.",

      "abstractNote": "Not all neural network architectures are created equal, some perform much better than others for certain tasks. But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

      "abstractNote": "Much of model-based reinforcement learning involves learning a model of an agent's world, and training an agent to leverage this model to perform a task more efficiently. While these models are demonstrably useful for agents, every naturally occurring model of the world of which we are aware---e.g., a brain---arose as the byproduct of competing evolutionary pressures for survival, not minimization of a supervised forward-predictive loss via gradient descent. That useful models can arise out of the messy and slow optimization process of evolution suggests that forward-predictive modeling can arise as a side-effect of optimization under the right circumstances. Crucially, this optimization process need not explicitly be a forward-predictive loss. In this work, we introduce a modification to traditional reinforcement learning which we call observational dropout, whereby we limit the agents ability to observe the real environment at each timestep. In doing so, we can coerce an agent into learning a world model to fill in the observation gaps during reinforcement learning. We show that the emerged world model, while not explicitly trained to predict the future, can help the agent learn key skills required to perform well in its environment.

      "abstractNote": "We study the estimation of the mutual information I(X; T ) between the input X to a deep neural network (DNN) and the output vector T of its th hidden layer (an “internal representation”). Focusing on feedforward networks with ﬁxed weights and noisy internal representations, we develop a rigorous framework for accurate estimation of I(X; T ). By relating I(X; T ) to information transmission over additive white Gaussian noise channels, we reveal that compression, i.e. reduction in I(X; T ) over the course of training, is driven by progressive geometric clustering of the representations of samples from the same class. Experimental results verify this connection. Finally, we shift focus to purely deterministic DNNs, where I(X; T ) is provably vacuous, and show that nevertheless, these models also cluster inputs belonging to the same class. The binningbased approximation of I(X; T ) employed in past works to measure compression is identiﬁed as a measure of clustering, thus clarifying that these experiments were in fact tracking the same clustering phenomenon. Leveraging the clustering perspective, we provide new evidence that compression and generalization may not be causally related and discuss potential future research ideas.",

      "abstractNote": "To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conﬂicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, ﬁrstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also ﬁnd that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to signiﬁcantly increased compression, while preventing overﬁtting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.",

      "abstractNote": "Several methods of estimating the mutual information of random variables have been developed in recent years. They can prove valuable for novel approaches to learning statistically independent features. In this paper, we use one of these methods, a mutual information neural estimation (MINE) network, to present a proof-of-concept of how a neural network can perform linear ICA. We minimize the mutual information, as estimated by a MINE network, between the output units of a diﬀerentiable encoder network. This is done by simple alternate optimization of the two networks. The method is shown to get a qualitatively equal solution to FastICA on blind-source-separation of noisy sources.",

      "abstractNote": "For many applications it is critical to know the uncertainty of a neural network’s predictions. While a variety of neural network parameter estimation methods have been proposed for uncertainty estimation, they have not been rigorously compared across uncertainty measures. We assess four of these parameter estimation methods to calibrate uncertainty estimation using four different uncertainty measures: entropy, mutual information, aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate the calibration of these parameter estimation methods using expected calibration error. Additionally, we propose a novel method of neural network parameter estimation called RECAST, which combines cosine annealing with warm restarts with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, capturing more diverse parameter distributions. When benchmarked against mutilated image data, we show that RECAST is well-calibrated and when combined with predictive entropy and epistemic uncertainty it offers the best calibrated measure of uncertainty when compared to recent methods.",

      "abstractNote": "Variational approaches based on neural networks are showing promise for estimating mutual information (MI) between high dimensional variables. However, they can be difﬁcult to use in practice due to poorly understood bias/variance tradeoffs. We theoretically show that, under some conditions, estimators such as MINE exhibit variance that could grow exponentially with the true amount of underlying MI. We also empirically demonstrate that existing estimators fail to satisfy basic self-consistency properties of MI, such as data processing and additivity under independence. Based on a uniﬁed perspective of variational approaches, we develop a new estimator that focuses on variance reduction. Empirical results on standard benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed estimator exhibits improved biasvariance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "Measuring Mutual Information (MI) between high-dimensional, continuous, random variables from observed samples has wide theoretical and practical applications. Recent work, MINE [5], focused on estimating tight variational lower bounds of MI using neural networks, but assumed unlimited supply of samples to prevent overﬁtting. In real world applications, data is not always available at a surplus. In this work, we focus on improving data efﬁciency and propose a Data-Efﬁcient MINE Estimator (DEMINE), by developing a relaxed predictive MI lower bound that can be estimated at higher data efﬁciency by orders of magnitudes. The predictive MI lower bound also enables us to develop a new meta-learning approach using task augmentation, Meta-DEMINE, to improve generalization of the network and further boost estimation accuracy empirically. With improved data-efﬁciency, our estimators enables statistical testing of dependency at practical dataset sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimators on synthetic benchmarks and a real world fMRI data, with application of inter-subject correlation analysis.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently, a method called the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) that uses neural networks has been proposed to estimate mutual information and more generally the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two distributions. The method uses the Donsker-Varadhan representation to arrive at the estimate of the KL divergence and is better than the existing estimators in terms of scalability and ﬂexibility. The output of MINE algorithm is not guaranteed to be a consistent estimator. We propose a new estimator that instead of searching among functions characterized by neural networks searches the functions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent. We carry out simulations and show that when the datasets are small the proposed estimator is more reliable than the MINE estimator and when the datasets are large the performance of the two methods are close.",

      "abstractNote": "Given the constant rise in quantity and quality of data obtained from neural systems on many scales ranging from molecular to systems', information-theoretic analyses became increasingly necessary during the past few decades in the neurosciences. Such analyses can provide deep insights into the functionality of such systems, as well as a rigid mathematical theory and quantitative measures of information processing in both healthy and diseased states of neural systems. This chapter will present a short introduction to the fundamentals of information theory, especially suited for people having a less firm background in mathematics and probability theory. To begin, the fundamentals of probability theory such as the notion of probability, probability distributions, and random variables will be reviewed. Then, the concepts of information and entropy (in the sense of Shannon), mutual information, and transfer entropy (sometimes also referred to as conditional mutual information) will be outlined. As these quantities cannot be computed exactly from measured data in practice, estimation techniques for information-theoretic quantities will be presented. The chapter will conclude with the applications of information theory in the field of neuroscience, including questions of possible medical applications and a short review of software packages that can be used for information-theoretic analyses of neural data.",

      "abstractNote": "We develop a general approach to distill symbolic representations of a learned deep model by introducing strong inductive biases. We focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The technique works as follows: we ﬁrst encourage sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations. We ﬁnd the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example—a detailed dark matter simulation—and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distributiondata better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.",

      "abstractNote": "Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used tools in statistics, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and scientiﬁc computation. However, despite their popularity, they can be diﬃcult to apply; all but the simplest classiﬁcation or regression applications require speciﬁcation and inference over complex covariance functions that do not admit simple analytical posteriors. Probabilistic programming shows potential for reducing the latter barrier, if the computational surface of a GP can be suitably packaged for cooperating with available generic inference tactics. This paper shows how to embed Gaussian processes in any higher-order probabilistic programming language, using an idiom based on memoization, and demonstrates its utility by implementing and extending classic and state-of-the-art GP applications. The interface to Gaussian processes, called gpmem, takes an arbitrary realvalued computational process as input and returns a statistical emulator that automatically improves as the original process is invoked and its input-output behavior is recorded. The ﬂexibility of gpmem is illustrated via three applications: (i) robust GP regression with hierarchical hyper-parameter learning, (ii) discovering symbolic expressions from time-series data by fully Bayesian structure learning over kernels generated by a stochastic grammar, and (iii) a bandit formulation of Bayesian optimization with automatic inference and action selection. All applications share a single 100-line Python library and require fewer than 20 lines of probabilistic code each.",

      "abstractNote": "A promising class of generative models maps points from a simple distribution to a complex distribution through an invertible neural network. Likelihood-based training of these models requires restricting their architectures to allow cheap computation of Jacobian determinants. Alternatively, the Jacobian trace can be used if the transformation is speciﬁed by an ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we use Hutchinson’s trace estimator to give a scalable unbiased estimate of the log-density. The result is a continuous-time invertible generative model with unbiased density estimation and one-pass sampling, while allowing unrestricted neural network architectures. We demonstrate our approach on high-dimensional density estimation, image generation, and variational inference, achieving the state-of-the-art among exact likelihood methods with efﬁcient sampling.",

      "abstractNote": "The next generation 21 cm surveys open a new window onto the early stages of cosmic structure formation and provide new insights about the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). However, the non-Gaussian nature of the 21 cm signal along with the huge amount of data generated from these surveys will require more advanced techniques capable to eﬃciently extract the necessary information to constrain the Reionization History of the Universe. In this paper we present the use of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to predict the posterior distribution for four astrophysical and cosmological parameters. Besides achieving state-of-the-art prediction performances, the proposed methods provide accurate estimation of parameters uncertainties and infer correlations among them. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantages of Normalizing Flows (NF) combined with BNNs, being able to model more complex output distributions and thus capture key information as non-Gaussianities in the parameter conditional density distribution for astrophysical and cosmological datasets. Finally, we propose novel calibration methods employing Normalizing Flows after training, to produce reliable predictions, and we demonstrate the advantages of this approach both in terms of computational cost and prediction performances.",

      "abstractNote": "We compare the discretize-optimize (Disc-Opt) and optimize-discretize (Opt-Disc) approaches for time-series regression and continuous normalizing ﬂows using neural ODEs. Neural ODEs, ﬁrst described in Chen et al. (2018), are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with neural network components; these models have competitively solved a variety of machine learning applications. Training a neural ODE can be phrased as an optimal control problem where the neural network weights are the controls and the hidden features are the states. Every iteration of gradient-based training involves solving an ODE forward in time and another backward in time, which can require large amounts of computation, time, and memory. Gholami et al. (2019) compared the Opt-Disc and Disc-Opt approaches for neural ODEs arising as continuous limits of residual neural networks used in image classiﬁcation tasks. Their ﬁndings suggest that Disc-Opt achieves preferable performance due to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend this comparison to neural ODEs applied to time-series regression and continuous normalizing ﬂows (CNFs). Timeseries regression and CNFs differ from classiﬁcation in that the actual ODE model is needed in the prediction and inference phase, respectively. Meaningful models must also satisfy additional requirements, e.g., the invertibility of the CNF. As the continuous model satisﬁes these requirements by design, Opt-Disc approaches may appear advantageous. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that with careful numerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as Opt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced costs in six out of seven separate problems with training time reduction ranging from 39% to 97%, and in one case, Disc-Opt reduced training from nine days to less than one day.",

Using the theory of rough paths, the underlying Brownian motion is treated as a latent variable and approximated, enabling eﬃcient training of neural SDEs as random neural ordinary diﬀerential equations. These SDEs can be used for constructing eﬃcient Markov chains to sample from the underlying distribution of a given dataset. Furthermore, by considering families of targeted SDEs with prescribed stationary distribution, we can apply VI to the optimization of hyperparameters in stochastic MCMC.",

      "abstractNote": "Generative ﬂows are promising tractable models for density modeling that deﬁne probabilistic distributions with invertible transformations. However, tractability imposes architectural constraints on generative ﬂows, making them less expressive than other types of generative models. In this work, we study a previously overlooked constraint that all the intermediate representations must have the same dimensionality with the original data due to invertibility, limiting the width of the network. We tackle this constraint by augmenting the data with some extra dimensions and jointly learning a generative ﬂow for augmented data as well as the distribution of augmented dimensions under a variational inference framework. Our approach, VFlow, is a generalization of generative ﬂows and therefore always performs better. Combining with existing generative ﬂows, VFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art 2.98 bits per dimension on the CIFAR-10 dataset and is more compact than previous models to reach similar modeling quality.",

      "abstractNote": "Flow-based generative models are composed of invertible transformations between two random variables of the same dimension. Therefore, ﬂow-based models cannot be adequately trained if the dimension of the data distribution does not match that of the underlying target distribution. In this paper, we propose SoftFlow, a probabilistic framework for training normalizing ﬂows on manifolds. To sidestep the dimension mismatch problem, SoftFlow estimates a conditional distribution of the perturbed input data instead of learning the data distribution directly. We experimentally show that SoftFlow can capture the innate structure of the manifold data and generate high-quality samples unlike the conventional ﬂow-based models. Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to 3D point clouds to alleviate the difﬁculty of forming thin structures for ﬂow-based models. The proposed model for 3D point clouds, namely SoftPointFlow, can estimate the distribution of various shapes more accurately and achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation.",

      "abstractNote": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks to bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract level, which makes it difﬁcult to implement high-level cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which veriﬁability is important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-ofconcept, we present a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system –though just a prototype – learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game.",

      "abstractNote": "Recent superhuman results in games have largely been achieved in a variety of zero-sum settings, such as Go and Poker, in which agents need to compete against others. However, just like humans, real-world AI systems have to coordinate and communicate with other agents in cooperative partially observable environments as well. These settings commonly require participants to both interpret the actions of others and to act in a way that is informative when being interpreted. Those abilities are typically summarized as theory of mind and are seen as crucial for social interactions. In this paper we propose two different search techniques that can be applied to improve an arbitrary agreed-upon policy in a cooperative partially observable game. The ﬁrst one, single-agent search, effectively converts the problem into a single agent setting by making all but one of the agents play according to the agreed-upon policy. In contrast, in multi-agent search all agents carry out the same common-knowledge search procedure whenever doing so is computationally feasible, and fall back to playing according to the agreed-upon policy otherwise. We prove that these search procedures are theoretically guaranteed to at least maintain the original performance of the agreed-upon policy (up to a bounded approximation error). In the benchmark challenge problem of Hanabi, our search technique greatly improves the performance of every agent we tested and when applied to a policy trained using RL achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 24.61 / 25 in the game, compared to a previous-best of 24.08 / 25.",

      "abstractNote": "Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artiﬁcial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.",

      "abstractNote": "Atari games have been a long-standing benchmark in the reinforcement learning (RL) community for the past decade. This benchmark was proposed to test general competency of RL algorithms. Previous work has achieved good average performance by doing outstandingly well on many games of the set, but very poorly in several of the most challenging games. We propose Agent57, the ﬁrst deep RL agent that outperforms the standard human benchmark on all 57 Atari games. To achieve this result, we train a neural network which parameterizes a family of policies ranging from very exploratory to purely exploitative. We propose an adaptive mechanism to choose which policy to prioritize throughout the training process. Additionally, we utilize a novel parameterization of the architecture that allows for more consistent and stable learning.",

      "abstractNote": "Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models which do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attentionbased architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at diﬀerent scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.",

      "abstractNote": "Financial time series forecasting is, without a doubt, the top choice of computational intelligence for ﬁnance researchers from both academia and ﬁnancial industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers came up with various models and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a signiﬁcant amount of surveys exist covering ML for ﬁnancial time series forecasting studies. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models started appearing within the ﬁeld, with results that signiﬁcantly outperform traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for ﬁnancial time series forecasting research, there is a lack of review papers that were solely focused on DL for ﬁnance. Hence, our motivation in this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review on DL studies for ﬁnancial time series forecasting implementations. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, commodity forecasting, but also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future for the ﬁeld by highlighting the possible setbacks and opportunities, so the interested researchers can beneﬁt.",

      "abstractNote": "Increasing model size when pretraining natural language representations often results in improved performance on downstream tasks. However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations and longer training times. To address these problems, we present two parameterreduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large. The code and the pretrained models are available at https://github.com/google-research/ALBERT.",

      "abstractNote": "Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and trafﬁc jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dotproduct self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length L, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we ﬁrst propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only O(L(log L)2) memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with ﬁne granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and realworld datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstractNote": "Music relies heavily on repetition to build structure and meaning. Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure. The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention, has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important. Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018). This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity for intermediate relative information is quadratic in the sequence length. We propose an algorithm that reduces their intermediate memory requirement to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modiﬁed relative attention mechanism can generate minutelong compositions (thousands of steps, four times the length modeled in Oore et al. (2018)) with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies1. We evaluate the Transformer with our relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and Piano-e-Competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.",

The models are efﬁcient and result in accurate performance on diverse transfer tasks. Two variants of the encoding models allow for trade-offs between accuracy and compute resources. For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We ﬁnd that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias. Our pre-trained sentence encoding models are made freely available for download and on TF Hub.",

      "abstractNote": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁnetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.",

      "abstractNote": "Forecasting of multivariate time series data, for instance the prediction of electricity consumption, solar power production, and polyphonic piano pieces, has numerous valuable applications. However, complex and non-linear interdependencies between time steps and series complicate this task. To obtain accurate prediction, it is crucial to model long-term dependency in time series data, which can be achieved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism. The typical attention mechanism reviews the information at each previous time step and selects relevant information to help generate the outputs; however, it fails to capture temporal patterns across multiple time steps. In this paper, we propose using a set of ﬁlters to extract time-invariant temporal patterns, similar to transforming time series data into its “frequency domain”. Then we propose a novel attention mechanism to select relevant time series, and use its frequency domain information for multivariate forecasting. We apply the proposed model on several real-world tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in almost all of cases. Our source code is available at https://github.com/gantheory/TPA-LSTM.",

      "abstractNote": "Financial time series prediction, especially with machine learning techniques, is an extensive ﬁeld of study. In recent times, deep learning methods (especially time series analysis)have performed outstandingly for various industrial problems, with better prediction than machine learning methods. Moreover, many researchers have used deep learning methods to predict ﬁnancial time series with various models in recent years. In this paper, we will compare various deep learning models, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), stacked long short-term memory (stacked LSTM), attention networks, and weighted attention networks for ﬁnancial time series prediction. In particular, attention LSTM is not only used for prediction, but also for visualizing intermediate outputs to analyze the reason of prediction; therefore, we will show an example for understanding the model prediction intuitively with attention vectors. In addition, we focus on time and factors, which lead to an easy understanding of why certain trends are predicted when accessing a given time series table. We also modify the loss functions of the attention models with weighted categorical cross entropy; our proposed model produces a 0.76 hit ratio, which is superior to those of other methods for predicting the trends of the KOSPI 200.",

      "abstractNote": "Causal inference can be formalized as Bayesian inference that combines a prior distribution over causal models and likelihoods that account for both observations and interventions. We show that it is possible to implement this approach using a sufﬁciently expressive probabilistic programming language. Priors are represented using probabilistic programs that generate source code in a domain speciﬁc language. Interventions are represented using probabilistic programs that edit this source code to modify the original generative process. This approach makes it straightforward to incorporate data from atomic interventions, as well as shift interventions, variance-scaling interventions, and other interventions that modify causal structure. This approach also enables the use of general-purpose inference machinery for probabilistic programs to infer probable causal structures and parameters from data. This abstract describes a prototype of this approach in the Gen probabilistic programming language.",

      "abstractNote": "Relying entirely on an attention mechanism, the Transformer introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) achieves state-of-the-art results for machine translation. In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it does not explicitly model relative or absolute position information in its structure. Instead, it requires adding representations of absolute positions to its inputs. In this work we present an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efﬁciently consider representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations, respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position representations yields no further improvement in translation quality. We describe an efﬁcient implementation of our method and cast it as an instance of relation-aware self-attention mechanisms that can generalize to arbitrary graphlabeled inputs.",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

      "abstractNote": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have obtained excellent result in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, understanding and interpreting the source of this success remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Recurrent Memory Network (RMN), a novel RNN architecture, that not only amplifies the power of RNN but also facilitates our understanding of its internal functioning and allows us to discover underlying patterns in data. We demonstrate the power of RMN on language modeling and sentence completion tasks. On language modeling, RMN outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on three large German, Italian, and English dataset. Additionally we perform in-depth analysis of various linguistic dimensions that RMN captures. On Sentence Completion Challenge, for which it is essential to capture sentence coherence, our RMN obtains 69.2% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.",

      "abstractNote": "Time series classiﬁcation (TSC), the problem of predicting class labels of time series, has been around for decades within the community of data mining and machine learning, and found many important applications such as biomedical engineering and clinical prediction. However, it still remains challenging and falls short of classiﬁcation accuracy and efﬁciency. Traditional approaches typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on which an oﬀ-the-shelf classiﬁer can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and separate the feature extraction part with the classiﬁcation part, which limits their accuracy performance. Plus, most existing methods fail to take into account the fact that time series often have features at diﬀerent time scales. To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network model, Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN), which incorporates feature extraction and classiﬁcation in a single framework. Leveraging a novel multi-branch layer and learnable convolutional layers, MCNN automatically extracts features at diﬀerent scales and frequencies, leading to superior feature representation. MCNN is also computationally eﬃcient, as it naturally leverages GPU computing. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with various existing methods on a large number of benchmark datasets, and show that MCNN advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods.",

The global average pooling in our convolutional model enables the exploitation of the Class Activation Map (CAM) to ﬁnd out the contributing region in the raw data for the speciﬁc labels.

      "abstractNote": "The Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model, which predicts the current value of a time series based upon its previous values as well as the current and past values of multiple driving (exogenous) series, has been studied for decades. Despite the fact that various NARX models have been developed, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies appropriately and select the relevant driving series to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the ﬁrst stage, we introduce an input attention mechanism to adaptively extract relevant driving series (a.k.a., input features) at each time step by referring to the previous encoder hidden state. In the second stage, we use a temporal attention mechanism to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-stage attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can also be easily interpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010 dataset and the NASDAQ 100 Stock dataset demonstrate that the DA-RNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods for time series prediction.",

      "abstractNote": "Time Series Classiﬁcation (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the ﬁeld of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classiﬁcation and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-ofthe-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a uniﬁed taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.",

      "abstractNote": "Transfer learning for deep neural networks is the process of ﬁrst training a base network on a source dataset, and then transferring the learned features (the network’s weights) to a second network to be trained on a target dataset. This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network’s generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classiﬁcation (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is ﬁne-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we ﬁll this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then ﬁne-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the models predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite the recent popularity of deep generative state space models, few comparisons have been made between network architectures and the inference steps of the Bayesian ﬁltering framework – with most models simultaneously approximating both state transition and update steps with a single recurrent neural network (RNN). In this paper, we introduce the Recurrent Neural Filter (RNF), a novel recurrent autoencoder architecture that learns distinct representations for each Bayesian ﬁltering step, captured by a series of encoders and decoders. Testing this on three real-world time series datasets, we demonstrate that the decoupled representations learnt improve the accuracy of one-step-ahead forecasts while providing realistic uncertainty estimates, and also facilitate multistep prediction through the separation of encoder stages.",

Inspired by this recent success, deep learning started to show promising results for Time Series Classiﬁcation (TSC). However, neural networks are still behind the state-of-the-art TSC algorithms, that are currently composed of ensembles of 37 non deep learning based classiﬁers. We attribute this gap in performance due to the lack of neural network ensembles for TSC. Therefore in this paper, we show how an ensemble of 60 deep learning models can signiﬁcantly improve upon the current state-of-the-art performance of neural networks for TSC, when evaluated over the UCR/UEA archive: the largest publicly available benchmark for time series analysis. Finally, we show how our proposed Neural Network Ensemble (NNE) is the ﬁrst time series classiﬁer to outperform COTE while reaching similar performance to the current state-of-the-art ensemble HIVE-COTE.",

      "abstractNote": "Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models which do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attentionbased architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at diﬀerent scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.",

Time series forecasting is a crucial task in modeling time series data, and is an important area of machine learning. In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast time series data. This approach works by leveraging selfattention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series data. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings.

In this article, we survey common encoder and decoder designs used in both one-step-ahead and multi-horizon time series forecasting -- describing how temporal information is incorporated into predictions by each model. Next, we highlight recent developments in hybrid deep learning models, which combine well-studied statistical models with neural network components to improve pure methods in either category. Lastly, we outline some ways in which deep learning can also facilitate decision support with time series data.",

      "abstractNote": "We present Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a general approach for learning node representations within graph-structured data in an unsupervised manner. DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs—both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classiﬁcation benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.",

      "abstractNote": "Transformers are powerful sequence models, but require time and memory that grows quadratically with the sequence length. In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations o√f the attention matrix which reduce this to O(n n). We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.",

      "abstractNote": "The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efﬁcient inference, focusing on mean-ﬁeld or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a signiﬁcant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying ﬂexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing ﬂow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing ﬂows to develop categories of ﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal ﬂows and provide a uniﬁed view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.",

      "abstractNote": "In the context of science, the well-known adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” might well be “a model is worth a thousand datasets.” Scientiﬁc models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simpliﬁcations of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientiﬁc basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are ﬂexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simpliﬁed models without requiring “big data”.",

      "abstractNote": "We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing ﬂows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.",

Algorithms for the two tasks, such as normalizing ﬂows and generative adversarial networks (GANs), are often developed independently. In this paper, we propose the concept of continuous-time ﬂows (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing ﬂows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efﬁcient inference, and learning an explicit energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Both tasks rely on a new technique for distribution matching within amortized learning. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques.",

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing ﬂow driven by a differential deformation of the continuous-time Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efﬁcient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior ﬂexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing ﬂows provide a general mechanism for deﬁning expressive probability distributions, only requiring the speciﬁcation of a (usually simple) base distribution and a series of bijective transformations. There has been much recent work on normalizing ﬂows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the ﬁeld has now matured and is in need of a uniﬁed perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing ﬂows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of ﬂow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-oﬀs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of ﬂows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of ﬂows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.",

Additionally, many existing methods focus on a single type of feature such as shape or frequency.

      "abstractNote": "Neural ordinary differential equations are an attractive option for modelling temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental issue is that the solution to an ordinary differential equation is determined by its initial condition, and there is no mechanism for adjusting the trajectory based on subsequent observations. Here, we demonstrate how this may be resolved through the well-understood mathematics of controlled differential equations. The resulting neural controlled differential equation model is directly applicable to the general setting of partiallyobserved irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efﬁcient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance against similar (ODE or RNN based) models in empirical studies on a range of datasets. Finally we provide theoretical results demonstrating universal approximation, and that our model subsumes alternative ODE models.",

The keys, queries, values and attention vectors of the network are considered as the unobserved stochastic states of its hidden structure. This generative model is such that at each time step the received observation is a random function of these past states in a given attention window. In this general state-space setting, we use Sequential Monte Carlo methods to approximate the posterior distributions of the states given the observations, and then to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood. We thus propose a generative model providing a predictive distribution, instead of a single-point estimate.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing ﬂows, autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing ﬂows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ as shown in Fig. 1. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the ﬁrst successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256×256 pixels.",

Despite their computational efﬁciency, ﬂow-based models generally have much worse density modeling performance compared to stateof-the-art autoregressive models. In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting design choices employed by ﬂow-based models in prior work: the use of uniform noise for dequantization, the use of inexpressive afﬁne ﬂows, and the use of purely convolutional conditioning networks in coupling layers. Based on our ﬁndings, we propose Flow++, a new ﬂow-based model that is now the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for unconditional density estimation on standard image benchmarks. Our work has begun to close the signiﬁcant performance gap that has so far existed between autoregressive models and ﬂow-based models.

Owing to the efﬁciency constraints on the design of the ﬂow layers, e.g. split coupling ﬂow layers in which approximately half the pixels do not undergo further transformations, they have limited expressiveness for modeling long-range data dependencies compared to autoregressive models that rely on conditional pixel-wise generation. In this work, we improve the representational power of ﬂow-based models by introducing channel-wise dependencies in their latent space through multi-scale autoregressive priors (mAR). Our mAR prior for models with split coupling ﬂow layers (mAR-SCF) can better capture dependencies in complex multimodal data. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art density estimation results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Furthermore, we show that mAR-SCF allows for improved image generation quality, with gains in FID and Inception scores compared to state-of-the-art ﬂow-based models.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing ﬂows are a powerful class of generative models for continuous random variables, showing both strong model ﬂexibility and the potential for non-autoregressive generation. These beneﬁts are also desired when modeling discrete random variables such as text, but directly applying normalizing ﬂows to discrete sequences poses signiﬁcant additional challenges. We propose a VAE-based generative model which jointly learns a normalizing ﬂow-based distribution in the latent space and a stochastic mapping to an observed discrete space. In this setting, we ﬁnd that it is crucial for the ﬂow-based distribution to be highly multimodal. To capture this property, we propose several normalizing ﬂow architectures to maximize model ﬂexibility. Experiments consider common discrete sequence tasks of character-level language modeling and polyphonic music generation. Our results indicate that an autoregressive ﬂow-based model can match the performance of a comparable autoregressive baseline, and a non-autoregressive ﬂow-based model can improve generation speed with a penalty to performance.",

We propose FlowGMM, an end-to-end approach to generative semi-supervised learning with normalizing ﬂows, using a latent Gaussian mixture model. FlowGMM is distinct in its simplicity, uniﬁed treatment of labelled and unlabelled data with an exact likelihood, interpretability, and broad applicability beyond image data. We show promising results on a wide range of applications, including AG-News and Yahoo Answers text data, tabular data, and semi-supervised image classiﬁcation. We also show that FlowGMM can discover interpretable structure, provide real-time optimization-free feature visualizations, and specify well calibrated predictive distributions.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing Flows (NFs) are able to model complicated distributions pY (y) with strong inter-dimensional correlations and high multimodality by transforming a simple base density pZ(z) through an invertible neural network under the change of variables formula. Such behavior is desirable in multivariate structured prediction tasks, where handcrafted per-pixel loss-based methods inadequately capture strong correlations between output dimensions. We present a study of conditional normalizing ﬂows (CNFs), a class of NFs where the base density to output space mapping is conditioned on an input x, to model conditional densities pY |X (y|x). CNFs are efﬁcient in sampling and inference, they can be trained with a likelihood-based objective, and CNFs, being generative ﬂows, do not suffer from mode collapse or training instabilities. We provide an effective method to train continuous CNFs for binary problems and in particular, we apply these CNFs to super-resolution and vessel segmentation tasks demonstrating competitive performance on standard benchmark datasets in terms of likelihood and conventional metrics.",

Semi-conditional architecture of the model allows us to efﬁciently compute a value and gradients of the marginal likelihood for unlabeled objects. The conditional part of the model is based on a proposed conditional coupling layer. We demonstrate a performance of the model for semi-supervised classiﬁcation problem on different datasets. The model outperforms the baseline approach based on variational autoencoders on MNIST dataset.",

Due to the invertibility, such models can score unseen data samples by computing their exact likelihood under the learned distribution. This makes ﬂowbased models a perfect tool for novelty detection, an anomaly detection technique where unseen data samples are classiﬁed as normal or abnormal by scoring them against a learned model of normal data. We show that normalizing ﬂows can be used as novelty detectors in time series. Two ﬂow-based models, Masked Autoregressive Flows and Free-form Jacobian of Reversible Dynamics restricted by autoregressive MADE networks, are tested on synthetic data and motor current data from an industrial machine and achieve good results, outperforming a conventional novelty detection method, the Local Outlier Factor.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing ﬂows can be used to construct high quality generative probabilistic models, but training and sample generation require repeated evaluation of Jacobian determinants and function inverses. To make such computations feasible, current approaches employ highly constrained architectures that produce diagonal, triangular, or low rank Jacobian matrices. As an alternative, we investigate a set of novel normalizing ﬂows based on the circular and symmetric convolutions. We show that these transforms admit efﬁcient Jacobian determinant computation and inverse mapping (deconvolution) in O(N log N ) time. Additionally, element-wise multiplication, widely used in normalizing ﬂow architectures, can be combined with these transforms to increase modeling ﬂexibility. We further propose an analytic approach to designing nonlinear elementwise bijectors that induce special properties in the intermediate layers, by implicitly introducing speciﬁc regularizers in the loss. We show that these transforms allow more effective normalizing ﬂow models to be developed for generative image models.",

      "abstractNote": "Flow-based generative models parameterize probability distributions through an invertible transformation and can be trained by maximum likelihood. Invertible residual networks provide a ﬂexible family of transformations where only Lipschitz conditions rather than strict architectural constraints are needed for enforcing invertibility. However, prior work trained invertible residual networks for density estimation by relying on biased log-density estimates whose bias increased with the network’s expressiveness. We give a tractable unbiased estimate of the log density using a “Russian roulette” estimator, and reduce the memory required during training by using an alternative inﬁnite series for the gradient. Furthermore, we improve invertible residual blocks by proposing the use of activation functions that avoid derivative saturation and generalizing the Lipschitz condition to induced mixed norms. The resulting approach, called Residual Flows, achieves state-of-theart performance on density estimation amongst ﬂow-based models, and outperforms networks that use coupling blocks at joint generative and discriminative modeling.",

      "abstractNote": "We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing ﬂows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.",

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efﬁcient by ﬁtting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reﬂected in experimental results.",

      "abstractNote": "Predicting the dependencies between observations from multiple time series is critical for applications such as anomaly detection, ﬁnancial risk management, causal analysis, or demand forecasting. However, the computational and numerical difﬁculties of estimating time-varying and high-dimensional covariance matrices often limits existing methods to handling at most a few hundred dimensions or requires making strong assumptions on the dependence between series. We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series. We show on several realworld datasets that our method provides signiﬁcant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines and perform an ablation study analyzing the contributions of the different components of our model.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing ﬂows provide a general mechanism for deﬁning expressive probability distributions, only requiring the speciﬁcation of a (usually simple) base distribution and a series of bijective transformations. There has been much recent work on normalizing ﬂows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the ﬁeld has now matured and is in need of a uniﬁed perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing ﬂows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of ﬂow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-oﬀs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of ﬂows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of ﬂows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.",

      "abstractNote": "In deep latent Gaussian models, the latent variable is generated by a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, where at each time step we pass the current state through a parametric nonlinear map, such as a feedforward neural net, and add a small independent Gaussian perturbation. This work considers the diﬀusion limit of such models, where the number of layers tends to inﬁnity, while the step size and the noise variance tend to zero. The limiting latent object is an Itô diﬀusion process that solves a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) whose drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcient are implemented by neural nets. We develop a variational inference framework for these neural SDEs via stochastic automatic diﬀerentiation in Wiener space, where the variational approximations to the posterior are obtained by Girsanov (mean-shift) transformation of the standard Wiener process and the computation of gradients is based on the theory of stochastic ﬂows. This permits the use of black-box SDE solvers and automatic diﬀerentiation for end-to-end inference. Experimental results with synthetic data are provided.",

      "abstractNote": "When the parameters are independently and identically distributed (initialized) neural networks exhibit undesirable properties that emerge as the number of layers increases, e.g. a vanishing dependency on the input and a concentration on restrictive families of functions including constant functions. We consider parameter distributions that shrink as the number of layers increases in order to recover well-behaved stochastic processes in the limit of inﬁnite depth. This leads to set forth a link between inﬁnitely deep residual networks and solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations, i.e. diﬀusion processes. We show that these limiting processes do not suﬀer from the aforementioned issues and investigate their properties.",

      "abstractNote": "Training neural ODEs on large datasets has not been tractable due to the necessity of allowing the adaptive numerical ODE solver to reﬁne its step size to very small values. In practice this leads to dynamics equivalent to many hundreds or even thousands of layers. In this paper, we overcome this apparent difﬁculty by introducing a theoretically-grounded combination of both optimal transport and stability regularizations which encourage neural ODEs to prefer simpler dynamics out of all the dynamics that solve a problem well. Simpler dynamics lead to faster convergence and to fewer discretizations of the solver, considerably decreasing wall-clock time without loss in performance. Our approach allows us to train neural ODE-based generative models to the same performance as the unregularized dynamics, with signiﬁcant reductions in training time. This brings neural ODEs closer to practical relevance in large-scale applications.",

We propose a remedy that encourages learned dynamics to be easier to solve. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a differentiable surrogate for the time cost of standard numerical solvers, using higher-order derivatives of solution trajectories. These derivatives are efﬁcient to compute with Taylormode automatic differentiation. Optimizing this additional objective trades model performance against the time cost of solving the learned dynamics. We demonstrate our approach by training substantially faster, while nearly as accurate, models in supervised classiﬁcation, density estimation, and time-series modelling tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "Normalizing ﬂows have shown great promise for modelling ﬂexible probability distributions in a computationally tractable way. However, whilst data is often naturally described on Riemannian manifolds such as spheres, torii, and hyperbolic spaces, most normalizing ﬂows implicitly assume a ﬂat geometry, making them either misspeciﬁed or ill-suited in these situations. To overcome this problem, we introduce Riemannian continuous normalizing ﬂows, a model which admits the parametrization of ﬂexible probability measures on smooth manifolds by deﬁning ﬂows as the solution to ordinary diﬀerential equations. We show that this approach can lead to substantial improvements on both synthetic and real-world data when compared to standard ﬂows or previously introduced projected ﬂows.",

      "abstractNote": "To better conform to data geometry, recent deep generative modelling techniques adapt Euclidean constructions to non-Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we study normalizing ﬂows on manifolds. Previous work has developed ﬂow models for speciﬁc cases; however, these advancements hand craft layers on a manifold-by-manifold basis, restricting generality and inducing cumbersome design constraints. We overcome these issues by introducing Neural Manifold Ordinary Differential Equations, a manifold generalization of Neural ODEs, which enables the construction of Manifold Continuous Normalizing Flows (MCNFs). MCNFs require only local geometry (therefore generalizing to arbitrary manifolds) and compute probabilities with continuous change of variables (allowing for a simple and expressive ﬂow construction). We ﬁnd that leveraging continuous manifold dynamics produces a marked improvement for both density estimation and downstream tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "The inﬁnite–depth paradigm pioneered by Neural ODEs has launched a renaissance in the search for novel dynamical system–inspired deep learning primitives; however, their utilization in problems of non–trivial size has often proved impossible due to poor computational scalability. This work paves the way for scalable Neural ODEs with time–to–prediction comparable to traditional discrete networks. We introduce hypersolvers, neural networks designed to solve ODEs with low overhead and theoretical guarantees on accuracy. The synergistic combination of hypersolvers and Neural ODEs allows for cheap inference and unlocks a new frontier for practical application of continuous–depth models. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks, such as sampling for continuous normalizing ﬂows, reveal consistent pareto efﬁciency over classical numerical methods.",

      "abstractNote": "Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientiﬁc and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multi-variate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multi-variate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing ﬂow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the ﬂexibility of ﬂows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.",
