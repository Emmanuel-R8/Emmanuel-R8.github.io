  abstract = {Recently, a method called the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) that uses neural networks has been proposed to estimate mutual information and more generally the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two distributions. The method uses the Donsker-Varadhan representation to arrive at the estimate of the KL divergence and is better than the existing estimators in terms of scalability and flexibility. The output of MINE algorithm is not guaranteed to be a consistent estimator. We propose a new estimator that instead of searching among functions characterized by neural networks searches the functions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent. We carry out simulations and show that when the datasets are small the proposed estimator is more reliable than the MINE estimator and when the datasets are large the performance of the two methods are close.},

This has led some to doubt the benefits of international diversification. This article solves the dynamic portfolio choice problem of a US investor faced with a time-varying investment opportunity set which may be characterized by correlations and volatilities that increase in bad times. We model the state dependance of US, UK, and German equity returns using a regime-switching model and find evidence for the existence of a high volatility regime, in which returns are more highly correlated and have lower means. Solving the dynamic asset allocation problem for a CCRA investor, we show international diversification is still valuable with regime changes. Currency hedging imparts further benefit. The costs of ignoring the regimes are small for moderate levels of risk aversion, and the intertemporal hedging demands induced by time-varying correlations are negligible.},

In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a `cobordism': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and `quantum topology'. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of `closed symmetric monoidal category'. We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

Invertible ResNets define a generative model which can be trained by maximum likelihood on unlabeled data. To compute likelihoods, we introduce a tractable approximation to the Jacobian log-determinant of a residual block. Our empirical evaluation shows that invertible ResNets perform competitively with both stateof-the-art image classifiers and flow-based generative models, something that has not been previously achieved with a single architecture.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The self-attention architecture allows us to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations. However, all-to-all attention severely hurts the scaling of the model to large sequences. Another limitation is that information about the context is stored in the same element-wise representations. This makes the processing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difficult. Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study two extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, and (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers on machine translation task and demonstrate that memory size positively correlates with the model performance. Attention patterns over the memory suggest that it improves the model's ability to process a global context. We expect that the application of Memory Transformer architectures to the tasks of language modeling, reading comprehension, and text summarization, as well as other NLP tasks that require the processing of long contexts will contribute to solving challenging problems of natural language understanding and generation.},

The models are efficient and result in accurate performance on diverse transfer tasks. Two variants of the encoding models allow for trade-offs between accuracy and compute resources. For both variants, we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with baselines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We find that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias.

In particular, the single flow learned by NODEs cannot express all homeomorphisms from a given data space to itself, and their static weight parametrization restricts the type of functions they can learn compared to discrete architectures with layer-dependent weights. Here, we describe a new module called neurallycontrolled ODE (N-CODE) designed to improve the expressivity of NODEs. The parameters of N-CODE modules are dynamic variables governed by a trainable map from initial or current activation state, resulting in forms of open-loop and closed-loop control, respectively. A single module is sufficient for learning a distribution on non-autonomous flows that adaptively drive neural representations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that N-CODE circumvents limitations of previous models and show how increased model expressivity manifests in several domains. In supervised learning, we demonstrate that our framework achieves better performance than NODEs as measured by both training speed and testing accuracy. In unsupervised learning, we apply this control perspective to an image autoencoder endowed with a latent transformation flow, greatly improving representational power over a vanilla model and leading to state-of-the-art image reconstruction on CIFAR-10.},

  abstract = {To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.},

Algorithms for the two tasks, such as normalizing flows and generative adversarial networks (GANs), are often developed independently. In this paper, we propose the concept of continuous-time flows (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Both tasks rely on a new technique for distribution matching within amortized learning. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques.},

Invertible residual networks provide a flexible family of transformations where only Lipschitz conditions rather than strict architectural constraints are needed for enforcing invertibility. However, prior work trained invertible residual networks for density estimation by relying on biased log-density estimates whose bias increased with the network's expressiveness. We give a tractable unbiased estimate of the log density using a ``Russian roulette'' estimator, and reduce the memory required during training by using an alternative infinite series for the gradient. Furthermore, we improve invertible residual blocks by proposing the use of activation functions that avoid derivative saturation and generalizing the Lipschitz condition to induced mixed norms. The resulting approach, called Residual Flows, achieves state-of-theart performance on density estimation amongst flow-based models, and outperforms networks that use coupling blocks at joint generative and discriminative modeling.},

We tackle this constraint by augmenting the data with some extra dimensions and jointly learning a generative flow for augmented data as well as the distribution of augmented dimensions under a variational inference framework. Our approach, VFlow, is a generalization of generative flows and therefore always performs better. Combining with existing generative flows, VFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art 2.98 bits per dimension on the CIFAR-10 dataset and is more compact than previous models to reach similar modeling quality.},

We derive an analytic solution for the long-only minimum variance portfolio under the assumption of a single-factor covariance matrix. The equation for optimal security weights has a simple and intuitive form that provides several insights on minimum variance portfolio composition. While high idiosyncratic risk can lead to a low security weight, high systematic risk takes the large majority of investable securities out of long-only solutions. The relatively small set of securities that remain have market betas below an analytically specified threshold beta. The ratio of portfolio beta to the threshold beta dictates the portion of ex-ante portfolio variance that is market-factor related. We verify and illustrate the portfolio mathematics using historical data on the U.S. equity market and explore how the single-factor analytic results compare to numerical optimization under a generalized covariance matrix. The analytic and empirical results of this study suggest that minimum variance portfolio performance is largely a function of the long-standing empirical critique of the traditional CAPM that low beta stocks have relatively high average returns.},

Complementary to these works, we propose methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT's attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT's attention.},

  abstract = {Time series classification (TSC), the problem of predicting class labels of time series, has been around for decades within the community of data mining and machine learning, and found many important applications such as biomedical engineering and clinical prediction. However, it still remains challenging and falls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on which an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and separate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits their accuracy performance. Plus, most existing methods fail to take into account the fact that time series often have features at different time scales. To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network model, Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN), which incorporates feature extraction and classification in a single framework. Leveraging a novel multi-branch layer and learnable convolutional layers, MCNN automatically extracts features at different scales and frequencies, leading to superior feature representation. MCNN is also computationally efficient, as it naturally leverages GPU computing. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with various existing methods on a large number of benchmark datasets, and show that MCNN advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods.},

  abstract = {Several data mining algorithms use iterative optimization methods for learning predictive models. It is not easy to determine upfront which optimization method will perform best or converge fast for such tasks. In this paper, we analyze Meta Algorithms (MAs) which work by adaptively combining iterates from a pool of base optimization algorithms. We show that the performance of MAs are competitive with the best convex combination of the iterates from the base algorithms for online as well as batch convex optimization problems. We illustrate the effectiveness of MAs on the problem of portfolio selection in the stock market and use several existing ideas for portfolio selection as base algorithms. Using daily S\&P500 data for the past 21 years and a benchmark NYSE dataset, we show that MAs outperform existing portfolio selection algorithms with provable guarantees by several orders of magnitude, and match the performance of the best heuristics in the pool.},

Portfolio performance is measured in terms of four metrics: volatility, Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, and turnover. Our empirical evidence shows that using option-implied volatility helps to reduce portfolio volatility, but does not improve the Sharpe ratio or certaintyequivalent return; option-implied correlation does not improve any of the metrics; however, expected returns estimated using information in the volatility risk premium and option-implied skewness increase substantially both the Sharpe ratio and certainty-equivalent return, even after prohibiting shortsales and accounting for transactions costs.},

Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.},

Copulas are multivariate functions that operate on marginal probability distributions and have the specific advantage of generalizing MV by flexibly modelling the forecasters residuals and then the dependence among them: a typical divide-and-conquer framework that can result in superior combined forecasters. The usefulness of the copulas-based combination method is highlighted by means of a comparison with SA and MV models, based on a number of simulated cases and a real-world time series.},

Randomized search methods such as stochastic clause selection (SCS) and rapid random restarts (RRR) have proven somewhat successful at addressing this weakness. However, on datasets where hypothesis evaluation is computationally expensive, even these algorithms may take unreasonably long to discover a good solution. We attempt to improve the performance of these algorithms on datasets by learning an approximation to ILP hypothesis evaluation. We generate a small set of hypotheses, uniformly sampled from the space of candidate hypotheses, and evaluate this set on actual data. These hypotheses and their corresponding evaluation scores serve as training data for learning an approximate hypothesis evaluator. We outline three techniques that make use of the trained evaluation-function approximator in order to reduce the computation required during an ILP hypothesis search. We test our approximate clause evaluation algorithm using the popular ILP system Aleph. Empirical results are provided on several benchmark datasets. We show that the clause evaluation function can be accurately approximated.},

It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.},

This chapter will present a short introduction to the fundamentals of information theory, especially suited for people having a less firm background in mathematics and probability theory. To begin, the fundamentals of probability theory such as the notion of probability, probability distributions, and random variables will be reviewed. Then, the concepts of information and entropy (in the sense of Shannon), mutual information, and transfer entropy (sometimes also referred to as conditional mutual information) will be outlined. As these quantities cannot be computed exactly from measured data in practice, estimation techniques for information-theoretic quantities will be presented. The chapter will conclude with the applications of information theory in the field of neuroscience, including questions of possible medical applications and a short review of software packages that can be used for information-theoretic analyses of neural data.},

  abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-ofthe-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Inspired by this recent success, deep learning started to show promising results for Time Series Classification (TSC). However, neural networks are still behind the state-of-the-art TSC algorithms, that are currently composed of ensembles of 37 non deep learning based classifiers. We attribute this gap in performance due to the lack of neural network ensembles for TSC. Therefore in this paper, we show how an ensemble of 60 deep learning models can significantly improve upon the current state-of-the-art performance of neural networks for TSC, when evaluated over the UCR/UEA archive: the largest publicly available benchmark for time series analysis. Finally, we show how our proposed Neural Network Ensemble (NNE) is the first time series classifier to outperform COTE while reaching similar performance to the current state-of-the-art ensemble HIVE-COTE.},

  abstract = {Transfer learning for deep neural networks is the process of first training a base network on a source dataset, and then transferring the learned features (the network's weights) to a second network to be trained on a target dataset. This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network's generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the models predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets.},

Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not taking into account any advancements made in the last 15 years. In this work, we present an account of these developments through a careful content analysis of 587 articles in BMA published between 1996 and 2014. We also develop a conceptual classification scheme to better describe this vast literature, understand its trends and future directions and provide guidance for the researcher interested in both the application and development of the methodology. The results of the classification scheme and content review are then used to discuss the present and future of the BMA literature.},

  abstract = {Much of model-based reinforcement learning involves learning a model of an agent's world, and training an agent to leverage this model to perform a task more efficiently. While these models are demonstrably useful for agents, every naturally occurring model of the world of which we are aware---e.g., a brain---arose as the byproduct of competing evolutionary pressures for survival, not minimization of a supervised forward-predictive loss via gradient descent. That useful models can arise out of the messy and slow optimization process of evolution suggests that forward-predictive modeling can arise as a side-effect of optimization under the right circumstances. Crucially, this optimization process need not explicitly be a forward-predictive loss. In this work, we introduce a modification to traditional reinforcement learning which we call observational dropout, whereby we limit the agents ability to observe the real environment at each timestep. In doing so, we can coerce an agent into learning a world model to fill in the observation gaps during reinforcement learning. We show that the emerged world model, while not explicitly trained to predict the future, can help the agent learn key skills required to perform well in its environment.

But how important are the weight parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights.

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks to bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which verifiability is important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-ofconcept, we present a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system \textendash though just a prototype \textendash{} learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game.},

To support this argument the most general Lorentzinvariant effective Lagrangian of massive vector bosons coupled to massless fermions is considered. Restrictions imposed on the interaction terms following from the consistency with the constraints of the second class and the perturbative renormalizability in the sense of effective field theories is analyzed. It is shown that the leading order effective Lagrangian containing interaction terms with dimensionless coupling constants coincides with the leading order effective Lagrangian of the locally invariant Yang-Mills theory up to globally invariant mass term of the vector bosons. Including the fermion masses and mixings and the interaction with the electromagnetic field leads to an effective field theory which at leading order looks like as if it was an SU (2) \texttimes{} U (1) gauge invariant theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking in unitary gauge with the scalar field replaced by its vacuum expectation value.},

  abstract = {In the United States as in other countries, political and economic divisions cut along geographic and demographic lines. Richer people are more likely to vote for Republican candidates while poorer voters lean Democratic; this is consistent with the positions of the two parties on economic issues. At the same time, richer states on the coasts are bastions of the Democrats, while most of the generally lower-income areas in the middle of the country strongly support Republicans. During a research project lasting several years, we reconciled these patterns by fitting a series of multilevel models to perform inference on geographic and demographic subsets of the population. We were using national survey data with relatively small samples in some states, ethnic groups and income categories; this motivated the use of Bayesian inference to partially pool between fitted models and local data. Previous, non-Bayesian analyses of income and voting had failed to connect individual and state-level patterns. Now that our analysis has been done, we believe it could be replicated using non-Bayesian methods, but Bayesian inference helped us crack the problem by directly handling the uncertainty that is inherent in working with sparse data.},

Focusing on feedforward networks with fixed weights and noisy internal representations, we develop a rigorous framework for accurate estimation of I(X; T ). By relating I(X; T ) to information transmission over additive white Gaussian noise channels, we reveal that compression, i.e. reduction in I(X; T ) over the course of training, is driven by progressive geometric clustering of the representations of samples from the same class. Experimental results verify this connection. Finally, we shift focus to purely deterministic DNNs, where I(X; T ) is provably vacuous, and show that nevertheless, these models also cluster inputs belonging to the same class. The binningbased approximation of I(X; T ) employed in past works to measure compression is identified as a measure of clustering, thus clarifying that these experiments were in fact tracking the same clustering phenomenon. Leveraging the clustering perspective, we provide new evidence that compression and generalization may not be causally related and discuss potential future research ideas.},

In this paper, we use Hutchinson's trace estimator to give a scalable unbiased estimate of the log-density. The result is a continuous-time invertible generative model with unbiased density estimation and one-pass sampling, while allowing unrestricted neural network architectures. We demonstrate our approach on high-dimensional density estimation, image generation, and variational inference, achieving the state-of-the-art among exact likelihood methods with efficient sampling.},

Time-variations in investment opportunities are driven by a regime switching process that can capture bull and bear states. We develop analytical methods that only require solving a small set of difference equations and thus are very convenient to use. These methods are applied to a simple portfolio selection problem involving choosing between a stock index and a risk-free asset in the presence of bull and bear states in the return distribution. If the market is in a bear state, investors increase allocations to stocks the longer their time horizon. Conversely, in bull markets it is optimal for investors to decrease allocations to stocks the longer their investment horizon.},

  abstract = {This paper studies strategic asset allocation and consumption choice in the presence of regime switching in asset returns. We find evidence that four separate regimes - characterized as crash, slow growth, bull and recovery states - are required to capture the joint distribution of stock and bond returns. Optimal asset allocations vary considerably across these states - both among bonds and stocks and among large and small stocks - and change over time as investors revise their estimates of the underlying state probabilities. In the crash state investors always allocate more of their portfolio to stocks the longer their investment horizon, while the optimal allocation to stocks declines as a function of the investment horizon in bull markets. The joint effects of learning about the underlying state probabilities and predictability of asset returns from the dividend yield give rise to a non-monotonic relationship between the investment horizon and the demand for stocks. Consumption-to-wealth ratios are found to depend on the underlying state and welfare costs from ignoring regime switching are substantial even after accounting for parameter uncertainty. Out-of-sample forecasting experiments confirm the economic importance of accounting for the presence of regimes in asset returns.},

  abstract = {Contract bridge is an example of an incomplete information game for which computers typically do not perform better than expert human bridge players. In particular, the typical bidding decisions of human bridge players are difficult to mimic with a computer program, and thus automatic bridge bidding remains to be a challenging research problem. Currently, the possibility of automatic bidding without mimicking human players has not been fully studied. In this work, we take an initiative to study such a possibility for the specific problem of bidding without competition. We propose a novel learning framework to let a computer program learn its own bidding decisions. The framework transforms the bidding problem into a learning problem, and then solves the problem with a carefully designed model that consists of cost-sensitive classifiers and upper-confidence-bound algorithms. We validate the proposed model and find that it performs competitively to the champion computer bridge program that mimics human bidding decisions.},

These SDEs can be used for constructing efficient Markov chains to sample from the underlying distribution of a given dataset.

Despite their computational efficiency, flow-based models generally have much worse density modeling performance compared to stateof-the-art autoregressive models. In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting design choices employed by flow-based models in prior work: the use of uniform noise for dequantization, the use of inexpressive affine flows, and the use of purely convolutional conditioning networks in coupling layers. Based on our findings, we propose Flow++, a new flow-based model that is now the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for unconditional density estimation on standard image benchmarks. Our work has begun to close the significant performance gap that has so far existed between autoregressive models and flow-based models.

However, the non-Gaussian nature of the 21 cm signal along with the huge amount of data generated from these surveys will require more advanced techniques capable to efficiently extract the necessary information to constrain the Reionization History of the Universe. In this paper we present the use of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to predict the posterior distribution for four astrophysical and cosmological parameters. Besides achieving state-of-the-art prediction performances, the proposed methods provide accurate estimation of parameters uncertainties and infer correlations among them. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantages of Normalizing Flows (NF) combined with BNNs, being able to model more complex output distributions and thus capture key information as non-Gaussianities in the parameter conditional density distribution for astrophysical and cosmological datasets. Finally, we propose novel calibration methods employing Normalizing Flows after training, to produce reliable predictions, and we demonstrate the advantages of this approach both in terms of computational cost and prediction performances.},

Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure. The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention, has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important. Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018). This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity for intermediate relative information is quadratic in the sequence length. We propose an algorithm that reduces their intermediate memory requirement to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate minutelong compositions (thousands of steps, four times the length modeled in Oore et al. (2018)) with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies1. We evaluate the Transformer with our relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and Piano-e-Competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.},

When input is corrupted, then the standard VAE lower bound involves marginalizing the encoder conditional distribution over the input noise, which makes the training criterion intractable. Instead, we propose a modified training criterion which corresponds to a tractable bound when input is corrupted.

Our approach extends the framework of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with a stochastic process term that models discrete events. We then model temporal point processes with a piecewise-continuous latent trajectory, where the discontinuities are caused by stochastic events whose conditional intensity depends on the latent state. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of our model on a range of synthetic and real-world marked point process datasets, including classical point processes (such as Hawkes processes), awards on Stack Overflow, medical records, and earthquake monitoring.},

We show that these transforms admit efficient Jacobian determinant computation and inverse mapping (deconvolution) in O(N log N ) time. Additionally, element-wise multiplication, widely used in normalizing flow architectures, can be combined with these transforms to increase modeling flexibility. We further propose an analytic approach to designing nonlinear elementwise bijectors that induce special properties in the intermediate layers, by implicitly introducing specific regularizers in the loss.

The resulting neural controlled differential equation model is directly applicable to the general setting of partiallyobserved irregularly-sampled multivariate time series, and (unlike previous work on this problem) it may utilise memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation even across observations.

In recent times, deep learning methods (especially time series analysis)have performed outstandingly for various industrial problems, with better prediction than machine learning methods. Moreover, many researchers have used deep learning methods to predict financial time series with various models in recent years. In this paper, we will compare various deep learning models, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), stacked long short-term memory (stacked LSTM), attention networks, and weighted attention networks for financial time series prediction. In particular, attention LSTM is not only used for prediction, but also for visualizing intermediate outputs to analyze the reason of prediction; therefore, we will show an example for understanding the model prediction intuitively with attention vectors. In addition, we focus on time and factors, which lead to an easy understanding of why certain trends are predicted when accessing a given time series table. We also modify the loss functions of the attention models with weighted categorical cross entropy; our proposed model produces a 0.76 hit ratio, which is superior to those of other methods for predicting the trends of the KOSPI 200.},

  abstract = {Flow-based generative models are composed of invertible transformations between two random variables of the same dimension. Therefore, flow-based models cannot be adequately trained if the dimension of the data distribution does not match that of the underlying target distribution. In this paper, we propose SoftFlow, a probabilistic framework for training normalizing flows on manifolds. To sidestep the dimension mismatch problem, SoftFlow estimates a conditional distribution of the perturbed input data instead of learning the data distribution directly. We experimentally show that SoftFlow can capture the innate structure of the manifold data and generate high-quality samples unlike the conventional flow-based models. Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to 3D point clouds to alleviate the difficulty of forming thin structures for flow-based models. The proposed model for 3D point clouds, namely SoftPointFlow, can estimate the distribution of various shapes more accurately and achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

The proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate posteriors. In addition, we demonstrate that a novel type of variational autoencoder, coupled with IAF, is competitive with neural autoregressive models in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images, while allowing significantly faster synthesis.},

Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of N times, where N is the number of layers.

We compare recently developed risk management methodologies: Conditional Value-at-Risk and Conditional Drawdown-atRisk with more established Mean-Absolute Deviation, Maximum Loss, and Market Neutrality approaches. The common property of considered risk management techniques is that they admit the formulation of a portfolio optimization model as a linear programming (LP) problem. LP formulations allow for implementing efficient and robust portfo lio allocation algorithms, which can successfully handle optimization problems with thousands of instruments and scenarios. The performance of various risk constraints is investigated and discussed in detail for in-sample and out-of-sample testing of the algorithm. The numerical experiments show that imposing risk constraints may improve the ``real'' performance of a portfolio rebalancing strategy in out-of-sample runs. It is beneficial to combine several types of risk constraints that control different sources of risk.},

For continuous distributions, CVaR is defined as the expected loss exceeding Value-at Risk (VaR). However, generally, CVaR is the weighted average of VaR and losses exceeding VaR. Central to the approach is an optimization technique for calculating VaR and optimizing CVaR simultaneously. This paper extends this approach to the optimization problems with CVaR constraints. In particular, the approach can be used for maximizing expected returns under CVaR constraints. Multiple CVaR constraints with various confidence levels can be used to shape the profit/loss distribution. A case study for the portfolio of S\&P 100 stocks is performed to demonstrate how the new optimization techniques can be implemented.},

Generative probabilistic models, or ``analysis-by-synthesis'' approaches, can capture rich scene structure but have been less widely applied than their discriminative counterparts, as they often require considerable problem-specific engineering in modeling and inference, and inference is typically seen as requiring slow, hypothesize-and-test Monte Carlo methods. Here we present Picture, a probabilistic programming language for scene understanding that allows researchers to express complex generative vision models, while automatically solving them using fast general-purpose inference machinery. Picture provides a stochastic scene language that can express generative models for arbitrary 2D/3D scenes, as well as a hierarchy of representation layers for comparing scene hypotheses with observed images by matching not simply pixels, but also more abstract features (e.g., contours, deep neural network activations). Inference can flexibly integrate advanced Monte Carlo strategies with fast bottomup data-driven methods. Thus both representations and inference strategies can build directly on progress in discriminatively trained systems to make generative vision more robust and efficient. We use Picture to write programs for 3D face analysis, 3D human pose estimation, and 3D object reconstruction \textendash{} each competitive with specially engineered baselines.},

  abstract = {Recent superhuman results in games have largely been achieved in a variety of zero-sum settings, such as Go and Poker, in which agents need to compete against others. However, just like humans, real-world AI systems have to coordinate and communicate with other agents in cooperative partially observable environments as well. These settings commonly require participants to both interpret the actions of others and to act in a way that is informative when being interpreted. Those abilities are typically summarized as theory of mind and are seen as crucial for social interactions. In this paper we propose two different search techniques that can be applied to improve an arbitrary agreed-upon policy in a cooperative partially observable game. The first one, single-agent search, effectively converts the problem into a single agent setting by making all but one of the agents play according to the agreed-upon policy. In contrast, in multi-agent search all agents carry out the same common-knowledge search procedure whenever doing so is computationally feasible, and fall back to playing according to the agreed-upon policy otherwise. We prove that these search procedures are theoretically guaranteed to at least maintain the original performance of the agreed-upon policy (up to a bounded approximation error). In the benchmark challenge problem of Hanabi, our search technique greatly improves the performance of every agent we tested and when applied to a policy trained using RL achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 24.61 / 25 in the game, compared to a previous-best of 24.08 / 25.},

In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dotproduct self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length L, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only O(L(log L)2) memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and realworld datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.},

In real world applications, data is not always available at a surplus. In this work, we focus on improving data efficiency and propose a Data-Efficient MINE Estimator (DEMINE), by developing a relaxed predictive MI lower bound that can be estimated at higher data efficiency by orders of magnitudes. The predictive MI lower bound also enables us to develop a new meta-learning approach using task augmentation, Meta-DEMINE, to improve generalization of the network and further boost estimation accuracy empirically. With improved data-efficiency, our estimators enables statistical testing of dependency at practical dataset sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimators on synthetic benchmarks and a real world fMRI data, with application of inter-subject correlation analysis.},

The method systematically combines information from historical forecasting models in real time with results from the large number of state-level opinion surveys that are released publicly during the campaign. The result is a set of forecasts that are initially as good as the historical model, then gradually increase in accuracy as Election Day nears. I employ a hierarchical specification to overcome the limitation that not every state is polled on every day, allowing the model to borrow strength both across states and, through the use of random-walk priors, across time. The model also filters away day-to-day variation in the polls due to sampling error and national campaign effects, which enables daily tracking of voter preferences towards the presidential candidates at the state and national levels. Simulation techniques are used to estimate the candidates' probability of winning each state and, consequently, a majority of votes in the Electoral College. I apply the model to pre-election polls from the 2008 presidential campaign and demonstrate that the victory of Barack Obama was never realistically in doubt. The model is currently ready to be deployed for forecasting the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.},

We overcome these issues by introducing Neural Manifold Ordinary Differential Equations, a manifold generalization of Neural ODEs, which enables the construction of Manifold Continuous Normalizing Flows (MCNFs). MCNFs require only local geometry (therefore generalizing to arbitrary manifolds) and compute probabilities with continuous change of variables (allowing for a simple and expressive flow construction).

Unexpectedly, we prove that the ELBO objective for the linear VAE does not introduce additional spurious local maxima relative to log marginal likelihood. We show further that training a linear VAE with exact variational inference recovers an identifiable global maximum corresponding to the principal component directions. Empirically, we find that our linear analysis is predictive even for high-capacity, non-linear VAEs and helps explain the relationship between the observation noise, local maxima, and posterior collapse in deep Gaussian VAEs.},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

Owing to the efficiency constraints on the design of the flow layers, e.g. split coupling flow layers in which approximately half the pixels do not undergo further transformations, they have limited expressiveness for modeling long-range data dependencies compared to autoregressive models that rely on conditional pixel-wise generation. In this work, we improve the representational power of flow-based models by introducing channel-wise dependencies in their latent space through multi-scale autoregressive priors (mAR). Our mAR prior for models with split coupling flow layers (mAR-SCF) can better capture dependencies in complex multimodal data. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art density estimation results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Furthermore, we show that mAR-SCF allows for improved image generation quality, with gains in FID and Inception scores compared to state-of-the-art flow-based models.},

Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a portfolio optimization model with a market neutral strategy under a Markov regime-switching framework. The selected investment instruments consist of the nine sector exchange traded funds (ETFs) that represent the U.S. stock market. The Bayesian information criterion is used to determine the optimal number of regimes. The investment objective is to dynamically maximize the portfolio alpha (excess return over the T-Bill) subject to neutralization of the portfolio sensitivities to the selected risk factors. The portfolio risk exposures are shown to change with various style and macro factors over time. The maximization problem in this context can be established as a regime-dependent linear programming problem. The optimal portfolio constructed as such is expected to outperform a naive benchmark strategy, which equally weights the ETFs. We evaluate the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of the regime-dependent market neutral strategy against the equally weighted strategy. We find that the former generally outperforms the latter.},

The keys, queries, values and attention vectors of the network are considered as the unobserved stochastic states of its hidden structure. This generative model is such that at each time step the received observation is a random function of these past states in a given attention window. In this general state-space setting, we use Sequential Monte Carlo methods to approximate the posterior distributions of the states given the observations, and then to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood. We thus propose a generative model providing a predictive distribution, instead of a single-point estimate.},

However, whilst data is often naturally described on Riemannian manifolds such as spheres, torii, and hyperbolic spaces, most normalizing flows implicitly assume a flat geometry, making them either misspecified or ill-suited in these situations. To overcome this problem, we introduce Riemannian continuous normalizing flows, a model which admits the parametrization of flexible probability measures on smooth manifolds by defining flows as the solution to ordinary differential equations. We show that this approach can lead to substantial improvements on both synthetic and real-world data when compared to standard flows or previously introduced projected flows.},

However, recent work has shown that data in some domains is better modeled by non-euclidean metric spaces, and inappropriate geometry can result in inferior performance. In this paper, we aim to eliminate the inductive bias imposed by the embedding space geometry. Namely, we propose to map data into more general non-vector metric spaces: a weighted graph with a shortest path distance. By design, such graphs can model arbitrary geometry with a proper configuration of edges and weights. Our main contribution is PRODIGE: a method that learns a weighted graph representation of data end-to-end by gradient descent. Greater generality and fewer model assumptions make PRODIGE more powerful than existing embedding-based approaches. We confirm the superiority of our method via extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks, including classification, compression, and collaborative filtering.},

  abstract = {Recent papers have demonstrated that both predicate invention and the learning of recursion can be efficiently implemented by way of abduction with respect to a meta-interpreter. This paper shows how Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) can be extended to implement a Bayesian posterior distribution over the hypothesis space by treating the meta-interpreter as a Stochastic Logic Program. The resulting M etaBayes system uses stochastic refinement to randomly sample consistent hypotheses which are used to approximate Bayes' Prediction. Most approaches to Statistical Relational Learning involve separate phases of model estimation and parameter estimation. We show how a variant of the MetaBayes approach can be used to carry out simultaneous model and parameter estimation for a new representation we refer to as a Super-imposed Logic Program (SiLPs). The implementation of this approach is referred to as M etaBayesSiLP . SiLPs are a particular form of ProbLog program, and so the parameters can also be estimated using the more traditional EM approach employed by ProbLog. This second approach is implemented in a new system called M ilP robLog. Experiments are conducted on learning grammars, family relations and a natural language domain. These demonstrate that M etaBayes outperforms M etaBayesMAP in terms of predictive accuracy and also outperforms both M ilP robLog and M etaBayesSiLP on log likelihood measures. However, M etaBayes incurs substantially higher running times than M etaBayesMAP . On the other hand, M etaBayes and M etaBayesSiLP have similar running times while both have much shorter running times than M ilP robLog.},

Given a graph, which is an abstraction of the relationships among entities, the task of link prediction is to anticipate future connections among entities in the graph, concerning its current state. Extensive studies have examined this problem from different aspects and proposed various methods, some of which might work very well for a specific application but not as a global solution. This work presents an extensive review of state-of-art methods and algorithms proposed on this subject and categorizes them into four main categories: similarity-based methods, probabilistic methods, relational models, and learning-based methods. Additionally, a collection of network data sets has been presented in this paper, which can be used to study link prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive study that considers all of the mentioned challenges and solutions for link prediction in graphs with the improvements in the recent years, including the unsupervised and supervised techniques and their evolution over the recent years.},

  abstract = {The problem of link prediction has recently attracted considerable attention by research community. Given a graph, which is an abstraction of the relationships among entities, the task of link prediction is to anticipate future connections among entities in the graph, concerning its current state. Extensive studies have examined this problem from different aspects and proposed various methods, some of which might work very well for a specific application but not as a global solution. This work presents an extensive review of state-of-art methods and algorithms proposed on this subject and categorizes them into four main categories: similarity-based methods, probabilistic methods, relational models, and learning-based methods. Additionally, a collection of network data sets has been presented in this paper, which can be used to study link prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive study that considers all of the mentioned challenges and solutions for link prediction in graphs with the improvements in the recent years, including the unsupervised and supervised techniques and their evolution over the recent years.},

This architecture uses four main components: parallel actors that generate new behaviour; parallel learners that are trained from stored experience; a distributed neural network to represent the value function or behaviour policy; and a distributed store of experience. We used our architecture to implement the Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2013). Our distributed algorithm was applied to 49 games from Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, using identical hyperparameters. Our performance surpassed non-distributed DQN in 41 of the 49 games and also reduced the wall-time required to achieve these results by an order of magnitude on most games.},

  abstract = {We compare the discretize-optimize (Disc-Opt) and optimize-discretize (Opt-Disc) approaches for time-series regression and continuous normalizing flows using neural ODEs. Neural ODEs, first described in Chen et al. (2018), are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with neural network components; these models have competitively solved a variety of machine learning applications. Training a neural ODE can be phrased as an optimal control problem where the neural network weights are the controls and the hidden features are the states. Every iteration of gradient-based training involves solving an ODE forward in time and another backward in time, which can require large amounts of computation, time, and memory. Gholami et al. (2019) compared the Opt-Disc and Disc-Opt approaches for neural ODEs arising as continuous limits of residual neural networks used in image classification tasks. Their findings suggest that Disc-Opt achieves preferable performance due to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend this comparison to neural ODEs applied to time-series regression and continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). Timeseries regression and CNFs differ from classification in that the actual ODE model is needed in the prediction and inference phase, respectively. Meaningful models must also satisfy additional requirements, e.g., the invertibility of the CNF. As the continuous model satisfies these requirements by design, Opt-Disc approaches may appear advantageous. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that with careful numerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as Opt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced costs in six out of seven separate problems with training time reduction ranging from 39\% to 97\%, and in one case, Disc-Opt reduced training from nine days to less than one day.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

This type of flow is closely related to Inverse Autoregressive Flow and is a generalization of Real NVP.

  abstract = {Ability of deep networks to extract high level features and of recurrent networks to perform time-series inference have been studied. In view of universality of one hidden layer network at approximating functions under weak constraints, the benefit of multiple layers is to enlarge the space of dynamical systems approximated or, given the space, reduce the number of units required for a certain error. Traditionally shallow networks with manually engineered features are used, back-propagation extent is limited to one and attempt to choose a large number of hidden units to satisfy the Markov condition is made. In case of Markov models, it has been shown that many systems need to be modeled as higher order. In the present work, we present deep recurrent networks with longer backpropagation through time extent as a solution to modeling systems that are high order and to predicting ahead. We study epileptic seizure suppression electro-stimulator. Extraction of manually engineered complex features and prediction employing them has not allowed small low-power implementations as, to avoid possibility of surgery, extraction of any features that may be required has to be included. In this solution, a recurrent neural network performs both feature extraction and prediction. We prove analytically that adding hidden layers or increasing backpropagation extent increases the rate of decrease of approximation error. A Dynamic Programming (DP) training procedure employing matrix operations is derived. DP and use of matrix operations makes the procedure efficient particularly when using data-parallel computing. The simulation studies show the geometry of the parameter space, that the network learns the temporal structure, that parameters converge while model output displays same dynamic behavior as the system and greater than .99 Average Detection Rate on all real seizure data tried.},

Despite the fact that various NARX models have been developed, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies appropriately and select the relevant driving series to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the first stage, we introduce an input attention mechanism to adaptively extract relevant driving series (a.k.a., input features) at each time step by referring to the previous encoder hidden state. In the second stage, we use a temporal attention mechanism to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-stage attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can also be easily interpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010 dataset and the NASDAQ 100 Stock dataset demonstrate that the DA-RNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods for time series prediction.},

Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring ``big data''.},

  abstract = {We show that the transformer attention mechanism is the update rule of a modern Hopfield network with continuous states. This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called "Hopfield", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multi-variate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multi-variate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.},

  abstract = {The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

These languages share a similar distribution semantics, and methods have been devised to translate programs between these languages. The complexity of computing the probability of queries to these general PLP programs is very high due to the need to combine the probabilities of explanations that may not be exclusive. As one alternative, the PRISM system reduces the complexity of query answering by restricting the form of programs it can evaluate.

  abstract = {Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.},

We also derive a general class of synthesis algorithms for domain-specific languages specified by probabilistic context-free grammars and establish the soundness of our approach for these languages. We apply the techniques to automatically synthesize probabilistic programs for time series data and multivariate tabular data. We show how to analyze the structure of the synthesized programs to compute, for key qualitative properties of interest, the probability that the underlying data generating process exhibits each of these properties. Second, we translate probabilistic programs in the domain-specific language into probabilistic programs in Venture, a general-purpose probabilistic programming system. The translated Venture programs are then executed to obtain predictions of new time series data and new multivariate data records. Experimental results show that our techniques can accurately infer qualitative structure in multiple real-world data sets and outperform standard data analysis methods in forecasting and predicting new data.},

The method is appropriate for jointly modeling hundreds of time series with widely varying, non-stationary dynamics. Given a collection of N time series, the Bayesian model first partitions them into independent clusters using a Chinese restaurant process prior. Within a cluster, all time series are modeled jointly using a novel ``temporally-reweighted'' extension of the Chinese restaurant process mixture. Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, which are then used to form predictive inferences.

UMAP is a non-parametric graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithm using applied Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology to find low-dimensional embeddings of structured data. The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) Compute a graphical representation of a dataset (fuzzy simplicial complex), and (2) Through stochastic gradient descent, optimize a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we replace the second step of UMAP with a deep neural network that learns a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We demonstrate that our method performs similarly to its non-parametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g. fast online embeddings for new data). We then show that UMAP loss can be extended to arbitrary deep learning applications, for example constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, and improving classifier accuracy for semi-supervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.},

However, the computational and numerical difficulties of estimating time-varying and high-dimensional covariance matrices often limits existing methods to handling at most a few hundred dimensions or requires making strong assumptions on the dependence between series. We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series. We show on several realworld datasets that our method provides significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines and perform an ablation study analyzing the contributions of the different components of our model.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used tools in statistics, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and scientific computation. However, despite their popularity, they can be difficult to apply; all but the simplest classification or regression applications require specification and inference over complex covariance functions that do not admit simple analytical posteriors. Probabilistic programming shows potential for reducing the latter barrier, if the computational surface of a GP can be suitably packaged for cooperating with available generic inference tactics. This paper shows how to embed Gaussian processes in any higher-order probabilistic programming language, using an idiom based on memoization, and demonstrates its utility by implementing and extending classic and state-of-the-art GP applications. The interface to Gaussian processes, called gpmem, takes an arbitrary realvalued computational process as input and returns a statistical emulator that automatically improves as the original process is invoked and its input-output behavior is recorded. The flexibility of gpmem is illustrated via three applications: (i) robust GP regression with hierarchical hyper-parameter learning, (ii) discovering symbolic expressions from time-series data by fully Bayesian structure learning over kernels generated by a stochastic grammar, and (iii) a bandit formulation of Bayesian optimization with automatic inference and action selection. All applications share a single 100-line Python library and require fewer than 20 lines of probabilistic code each.},

Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice. This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii) represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over both non-parametric and standard regression baselines.},

Minimum variance investing is one of these popular rule driven, i.e. new passive concepts. I show in this paper theoretically and empirically that the portfolio construction process behind minimum variance investing implicitly picks up risk-based pricing anomalies. In other words the minimum variance tends to hold low beta and low residual risk stocks. Long/short portfolios based on these characteristics have been associated in the empirical literature with risk-adjusted outperformance (alpha). This paper shows that 83\% of the variation of the minimum variance portfolio excess returns (relative to a capitalization weighted alternative) can be attributed to the FAMA/FRENCH factors as well as to the returns on two characteristic anomaly portfolios. All regression coefficients (factor exposures) are highly significant, stable over the estimation period and correspond remarkably well with our economic intuition.},

When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations, respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position representations yields no further improvement in translation quality.

  abstract = {Forecasting of multivariate time series data, for instance the prediction of electricity consumption, solar power production, and polyphonic piano pieces, has numerous valuable applications. However, complex and non-linear interdependencies between time steps and series complicate this task. To obtain accurate prediction, it is crucial to model long-term dependency in time series data, which can be achieved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism. The typical attention mechanism reviews the information at each previous time step and selects relevant information to help generate the outputs; however, it fails to capture temporal patterns across multiple time steps. In this paper, we propose using a set of filters to extract time-invariant temporal patterns, similar to transforming time series data into its ``frequency domain''. Then we propose a novel attention mechanism to select relevant time series, and use its frequency domain information for multivariate forecasting. We apply the proposed model on several real-world tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in almost all of cases. Our source code is available at https://github.com/gantheory/TPA-LSTM.},

  abstract = {Variational approaches based on neural networks are showing promise for estimating mutual information (MI) between high dimensional variables. However, they can be difficult to use in practice due to poorly understood bias/variance tradeoffs. We theoretically show that, under some conditions, estimators such as MINE exhibit variance that could grow exponentially with the true amount of underlying MI. We also empirically demonstrate that existing estimators fail to satisfy basic self-consistency properties of MI, such as data processing and additivity under independence. Based on a unified perspective of variational approaches, we develop a new estimator that focuses on variance reduction. Empirical results on standard benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed estimator exhibits improved biasvariance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.},

We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.

  abstract = {Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective, 2nd edition, gives a unified perspective on machine learning by covering both pillars of supervised learning, namely regression and classification. The book starts with the basics, including mean square, least squares and maximum likelihood methods, ridge regression, Bayesian decision theory classification, logistic regression, and decision trees. It then progresses to more recent techniques, covering sparse modelling methods, learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and support vector machines, Bayesian inference with a focus on the EM algorithm and its approximate inference variational versions, Monte Carlo methods, probabilistic graphical models focusing on Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models and particle filtering. Dimensionality reduction and latent variables modelling are also considered in depth. This palette of techniques concludes with an extended chapter on neural networks and deep learning architectures. The book also covers the fundamentals of statistical parameter estimation, Wiener and Kalman filtering, convexity and convex optimization, including a chapter on stochastic approximation and the gradient descent family of algorithms, presenting related online learning techniques as well as concepts and algorithmic versions for distributed optimization. Focusing on the physical reasoning behind the mathematics, without sacrificing rigor, all the various methods and techniques are explained in depth, supported by examples and problems, giving an invaluable resource to the student and researcher for understanding and applying machine learning concepts. Most of the chapters include typical case studies and computer exercises, both in MATLAB and Python. The chapters are written to be as self-contained as possible, making the text suitable for different courses: pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models. New to this edition:     Complete re-write of the chapter on Neural Networks and Deep Learning to reflect the latest advances since the 1st edition. The chapter, starting from the basic perceptron and feed-forward neural networks concepts, now presents an in depth treatment of deep networks, including recent optimization algorithms, batch normalization, regularization techniques such as the dropout method, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms, adversarial examples and training, capsule networks and generative architectures, such as restricted Boltzman machines (RBMs), variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Standard linear regression algorithms generate biased regression estimates if input noise is present and suffer numerically when the data contains redundancy and irrelevancy. Inspired by Factor Analysis Regression, we develop a variational Bayesian algorithm that is robust to ill-conditioned data, automatically detects relevant features, and identifies input and output noise \textendash{} all in a computationally efficient way.

This paper presents a simple and intuitive explanation for posterior collapse through the analysis of linear VAEs and their direct correspondence with Probabilistic PCA (pPCA). We identify how local maxima can emerge from the marginal log-likelihood of pPCA, which yields similar local maxima for the evidence lower bound (ELBO). We show that training a linear VAE with variational inference recovers a uniquely identifiable global maximum corresponding to the principal component directions. We provide empirical evidence that the presence of local maxima causes posterior collapse in non-linear VAEs. Our findings help to explain a wide range of heuristic approaches in the literature that attempt to diminish the effect of the KL term in the ELBO to alleviate posterior collapse.},

This work considers the diffusion limit of such models, where the number of layers tends to infinity, while the step size and the noise variance tend to zero. The limiting latent object is an It\^o diffusion process that solves a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose drift and diffusion coefficient are implemented by neural nets. We develop a variational inference framework for these neural SDEs via stochastic automatic differentiation in Wiener space, where the variational approximations to the posterior are obtained by Girsanov (mean-shift) transformation of the standard Wiener process and the computation of gradients is based on the theory of stochastic flows. This permits the use of black-box SDE solvers and automatic differentiation for end-to-end inference. Experimental results with synthetic data are provided.},

  abstract = {This report makes a more detailed assessment of the CVaR regression method proposed in [3] for determining A-Basis and B-Basis allowables, and quantifying the impact of test data and different analytical models on failure load predictions. Although the method can in principle be applied to any desired quantile, we will focus only on the 10th (B-Basis) in this study. We consider failure data arising from two sources: (1) a controlled environment where data is simulated from different Weibull distributions; (2) a supplied dataset similar to that of [3] augmented with failure load predictions from two additional analytical models (Model S2 and Model S3). Using absolute deviation between true and estimated 10th percentiles and the CVaR regression goodness-of-fit measure introduced in [3] as accuracy-assessment criteria, the key findings are as follows. The accuracy of CVaR regression is relatively insensitive to the number of batches present, but fairly sensitive to the number of test points per batch3. There are diminishing benefits in using more than 10 batches, or more than 10 test points per batch, in any one application of CVaR regression. The estimates of A-basis and B-basis are fairly robust, in the sense that they are not severely affected by miscalibrations (biases or errors) in the analytical models. Among the analytical models used as the sole input with no (input) test data, the best performer is Model S, followed by Model S2. Model S3 is the worst performer. The models contribute substantially to percentile prediction when up to 3 test points are used as input. When 4 test points are used as input, the 3 models can be roughly equated to the input information provided by one additional test point.},

  abstract = {We propose a coherent methodology for integrating various sources of variability on properties of materials in order to accurately predict percentiles of their failure load distribution. The approach involves the linear combination of factors that are associated with failure load, into a statistical factor model. This model directly estimates percentiles of the failure load distribution (rather than mean values as in ordinary least squares regression). A regression framework with CVaR deviation as the measure of optimality, is used in constructing the estimates. We consider estimates of confidence intervals for the estimates of percentiles, and adopt the most promising of these to compute A-Basis and B-Basis values. Numerical experiments with the available dataset show that the approach is quite robust, and can lead to a significant savings in number of actual testings. The approach pools together information from earlier experiments and model runs, with new experiments and model predictions, resulting in accurate inferences even in the presence of relatively small datasets.},

  abstract = {Normalizing flows, autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ as shown in Fig. 1. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256\texttimes 256 pixels.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from O(n2) to O(n) in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the Linformer, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.},

CNFs are efficient in sampling and inference, they can be trained with a likelihood-based objective, and CNFs, being generative flows, do not suffer from mode collapse or training instabilities. We provide an effective method to train continuous CNFs for binary problems and in particular, we apply these CNFs to super-resolution and vessel segmentation tasks demonstrating competitive performance on standard benchmark datasets in terms of likelihood and conventional metrics.},

  abstract = {Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been attracting increasing attention in various research domains recently. There have been some works studying optimization issues and approximation capabilities of neural ODEs, but their robustness is still yet unclear. In this work, we fill this important gap by exploring robustness properties of neural ODEs both empirically and theoretically. We first present an empirical study on the robustness of the neural ODE-based networks (ODENets) by exposing them to inputs with various types of perturbations and subsequently investigating the changes of the corresponding outputs. In contrast to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we find that the ODENets are more robust against both random Gaussian perturbations and adversarial attack examples. We then provide an insightful understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting a certain desirable property of the flow of a continuous-time ODE, namely that integral curves are non-intersecting. Our work suggests that, due to their intrinsic robustness, it is promising to use neural ODEs as a basic block for building robust deep network models. To further enhance the robustness of vanilla neural ODEs, we propose the time-invariant steady neural ODE (TisODE), which regularizes the flow on perturbed data via the time-invariant property and the imposition of a steady-state constraint. We show that the TisODE method outperforms vanilla neural ODEs and also can work in conjunction with other state-of-the-art architectural methods to build more robust deep networks.},

The model includes an upper-confidence-bound algorithm and additional techniques to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation.

  abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

  abstract = {Phanagoria \textendash{} the largest known ancient Greek settlement on the territory of Russia is situated on the Taman peninsula on the southern side of the Taman bay. The unique feature of the site is that about 1/3 of the settlement of Phanagoria is currently flooded by waters of the Taman bay due to the transgression of the Black sea level since antiquity. In 2012 in the course of underwater prospection of the Taman bay a wooden ship buried under the 1.5 m thick bottom sediments was discovered in situ. The unique feature of the ship is excellent preservation of its wooden parts, which makes it one of the few finds of this kind ever made on the territory of Russia. This paper presents a case-study of application of photogrammetry technique for archaeological field documentation record in course of underwater excavations of the Phanagorian shipwreck. The advantages and possible underwaterspecific constraints of automated point cloud extraction algorithm which was used in the research are discussed. The paper gives an overview of the practical aspects of the workflow of photgrammetry technique application at the excavation ground: photo capture procedure and measurement of control points. Finally a resulting 3-D model of the shipwreck is presented and high potential of automated point cloud extraction algorithms for archaeological documentation record is concluded.},

  abstract = {Normalizing flows are a powerful class of generative models for continuous random variables, showing both strong model flexibility and the potential for non-autoregressive generation. These benefits are also desired when modeling discrete random variables such as text, but directly applying normalizing flows to discrete sequences poses significant additional challenges. We propose a VAE-based generative model which jointly learns a normalizing flow-based distribution in the latent space and a stochastic mapping to an observed discrete space. In this setting, we find that it is crucial for the flow-based distribution to be highly multimodal. To capture this property, we propose several normalizing flow architectures to maximize model flexibility. Experiments consider common discrete sequence tasks of character-level language modeling and polyphonic music generation. Our results indicate that an autoregressive flow-based model can match the performance of a comparable autoregressive baseline, and a non-autoregressive flow-based model can improve generation speed with a penalty to performance.},
