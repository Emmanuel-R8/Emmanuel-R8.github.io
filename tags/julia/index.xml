      <description>The Neherlab COVID-19 forecast model using CSV, Dates; using DataFrames, DataFramesMeta; using Plots, PyPlot; using DifferentialEquations; This is more a data science post than machine learning. It was born after reading a report from Imperial College London and finding a forecasting model by NeherLab. The numbers produced by those models can only be described as terrifying.
How do those models work? How are they calibrated?
BUT
Remember that whatever concerns one can have about their precision, those models are all absolutely clear that social-distancing, quarantining have a massive impact on death rates.</description>
