      <description>Blogdown I have been a happy user of R markdown and bookdown developed by Yixui Xie. When I decided to start this blog, giving blogdown a try was a no-brainer. To be honest, it was not my first choice. Jekyll was #1 given itâ€™s good support by GitHub pages. Then I took a dive with Pelican. Both are impressive, but both brought equally painful theming: the base theme sort of works, and only sort of, but anyway was not what I wanted.</description>
