      <description>Jump there if in a hurry for maths
This post is about an effort to replicate the model made available by NeherLab.
While it is an nice piece of work, it is entirely written in Javascript which makes the model itself difficult to audit and modify. This is a re-implementation in Julia. Why Julia? Because it is clear to read, matches mathematical notation and it is fast. Very fast. This will be necessary when doing parameter estimation to improve its quality.</description>
