&lt;p&gt;Both capstones for the HarvardX certificates are now available. Just click on the &lt;code&gt;Projects&lt;/code&gt; link!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Gitbooks are not your thing, at the top of their main page, there is a download link to a pdf version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make for a good knock-me-asleep reading…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HarvardX Final Report - LendingClub dataset</title>
      <link>/2019/12/11/harvardx-final-report-lendingclub-dataset.html</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;After 3 months of work, the final report for the HarvardX Data Science course was submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is based on the LendingClub dataset. LendingClub is a peer-2-peer lender. This is a matching of private borrowers and investors. Small amounts, fairly high risk (if they could, borrowers would probably have had a bank involved). Surprisingly, after tapping a market of individual lenders, the biggest lenders are now the banks. To inform the investors, LendingClub make historical information publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work went through many blind alleys. I won’t list them, they are in the report (post-mortem section). But it was an overall enriching experience. I learned a lot, often about limitations of what I tried (the dataset is big with a few millions samples (big for an old laptop), with many (ca. 150) mispecified mixed categorical and numeric variables). The experience will be filed in the &lt;em&gt;‘it-builds-character’&lt;/em&gt; category…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One point that is still tingling my mind is learning about Conditional Inference Trees used to bin variables. That is then used for logistic regression to predict probabilities of loan default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are those trees interesting? They are sourced in information theory and measure the information content of a prediction variable to predict a binary response. The prediction variable is then partitioned in a few intervals (bins). What is great?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurement does NOT rely on the value of the prediction variable. This means that variable NAs go from being a nuisance to being stashed in a bin of their own treated as any other bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The logistic regression context predicates binary variables which were perfect for the purpose of this report. But those trees do not require binary outcomes. They rely on what are called &lt;em&gt;Weight of Evidence&lt;/em&gt; (calculated for each bin) and &lt;em&gt;Information Value&lt;/em&gt; (calculated for each variable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculations are very quick (about 1/10th second to bin 1 million samples) with a small memory footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, whatever comes in, we do not have to worry about scaling/z-scoring/filling NAs; it is quickly reformatted into a handful (literally of that order of magnitude depending on parameters used) based on the relevance to predicting what needs to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I didn’t know better, this should be called &lt;em&gt;model impedance matching&lt;/em&gt; (electrical engineers can explain)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, the number of avenues to explore with this dataset (especially using data from other sources) could fill many more months. I listed a list of possible techniques in the report’s conclusion. This is what does and will keep banks’ credit risk departments busy and well-staffed…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am working on making the MovieLens and LendingClub reports available as gitbooks. To be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick Thought: Universal translator and same language translator</title>
      <link>/2019/10/25/quick-idea-universal-translator-and-same-language-translator.html</link>

      <description>


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Thoughts are random thoughts looking for comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine a universal translator able to translate any language to any language. Sourcing a corpus of pair translation is a major hurdle. However there is an almost infinite corpus of pair translations: a language with itself; translating English to English is easy, even for a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s give the blackbox universal translator three inputs: a source text, the language of the source text, the language of the desired translation. What would be the consequences for the learning system inside the blackbox of being constrained that if the languages are the same, the output has to be identical to the input?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the blackbox could quickly learn that bypassing the translation does the trick. However, that would probably require the internal circuitry to allow for the bypass, and that could be constrained out. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could we expect any interesting result?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could the input to be eventually forced down to a language-independent universal representation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s say there is a language-independent universal representation kernel. If the input comes in without information of which is the output language, and the output has no information of what the input language was, does it force the network to create a universal representation, or would it just withered away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to &lt;em&gt;invert&lt;/em&gt; a network? Probably not in a truly bijective way, but to model the fact that text representation &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; universal representation is the &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; (for some definition of the word) of universal representation &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\rightarrow\)&lt;/span&gt; text representation of the same language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments welcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently finished to penultimate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Emmanuel-R8/capstone-movielens/blob/master/MovieLens.pdf&#34;&gt;final assignment&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science&#34;&gt;HarvardX Data Science course&lt;/a&gt;. The Stanford course was clearly machine learning. This one is definitely lighter on the machine learning and much heavier on the data science: how to source, clean and visualise data are key skills. The targeted knowledge is more traditional probabilities/statistics. Long-existing fundamental techniques like inference, polling are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time R is the centre tool of the course. It makes clear sense. When I started learning it about 15 years ago, I loathed the multiple gotchas. Since then, new libraries have simplified base R and removed its exceptions and exceptions to exceptions. In addition the &lt;code&gt;Rcpp&lt;/code&gt; library has eased implementation of efficient algorithms and interfacing with popular libraries. Still not a speed demon, but not the snail it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go through the project and my models. No revolutionary concepts. Just great results. I took half a day to reimplement in Julia, both to crosscheck and personal training. As expected, a lot easier to read. But the big surprise was the speed difference. Although I didn’t time it, Julia only felt about twice quicker. Credit to the R project folks (I only used matrices operations, no modeling libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this report, I got grades that can’t be improved upon. Happy camper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;review&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently completed the Stanford online version of the Machine Learning CS229 course taught by Andrew Ng. There is no need to introduce this course which has reached &lt;em&gt;stardom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often was a trip a trip down memory lane repeating what I studied in the late 90’ies. It was interesting that quite a bit has remained as relevant. Back then, and I am now talking early 90ies, neural networks were still fashionable but computationally intractable past what would hardly be considered a single layer nowadays. Backpropagation was already used, but similarly quickly tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough recalling old times… There was plenty I had not done back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was extremely pleasant. The progression made sense, pace was enjoyable. In particular, the blackboard style presentation was great. Following along with pen and paper made things easily stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every piece of code had to be written in Matlab/Octave. The choice was surprising in those days and age where R has been a mainstay of statistics and statistical learning, and Python is now the language of choice to glue and interface so many optimised C/C++ libraries (in addition to its natural qualities). But the rationale of Matlab/Octave being very natural to implement algorithms where matrices are the mathematical object of choice, made sense. The learning curve was easy, code looked very legible and natural. For short scripts, all good. For anybody who thinks that his/her code will one day be maintained by a psychopath who know his/her address, Matlab/Octave is to be left as a Wikipedia article. Maybe Julia will become a better choice. (Numpy matrix calcs looks very far from mathematical formalism and easy to bug up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was light on the theory side. No surprise: long curriculum, few hours. On the flip side, the recurring emphasis on the ‘what does it mean?’, developing intuitions and, in particular, the hammering about bias/complexity or bias/variance trade-off would be of great value to anyone entering the field. There is a somewhat prevalent meme that machine learning only works because we now have train loads of sdcards of data, and that if something doesn’t quite work, just throw more data at it. Hammering that trade off will hopefully make many become at least sceptical. More data is not a magic wand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;exercises-and-grading&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Exercises and grading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automated grading grading system was surprisingly efficient. There were a few gotchas on exact spelling or white spaces. But overall, no complaints. And given the lack of real-people face-to-face time, this was a nice alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regular coding exams were interesting and the backend infrastructure worked great. As time progressed, the difficulty significantly dropped because of the more difficult content (harder to draft an exercise that really really covers content that was superficially addressed). The course 6 exam was clearly the hardest for many of the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth it? On a personal level, definitely. And impossible to beat the value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a carrer-enhancing proposition, it remains to be seen, and I’ll need to see it to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
