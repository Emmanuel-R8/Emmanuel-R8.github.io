      <description>After 3 months of work, the final report for the HarvardX Data Science course was submitted.
It is based on the LendingClub dataset. LendingClub is a peer-2-peer lender. This is a matching of private borrowers and investors. Small amounts, fairly high risk (if they could, borrowers would probably have had a bank involved). Surprisingly, after tapping a market of individual lenders, the biggest lenders are now the banks. To inform the investors, LendingClub make historical information publicly available.</description>

      <description>Blogdown I have been a happy user of R markdown and bookdown developed by Yixui Xie. When I decided to start this blog, giving blogdown a try was a no-brainer. To be honest, it was not my first choice. Jekyll was #1 given itâ€™s good support by GitHub pages. Then I took a dive with Pelican. Both are impressive, but both brought equally painful theming: the base theme sort of works, and only sort of, but anyway was not what I wanted.</description>
