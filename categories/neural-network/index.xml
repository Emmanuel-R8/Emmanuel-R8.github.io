      <description>This is the first post of series dedicated to Compressive Memory of Recurrent Neural Networks. This is inspired by a recent DeepMind paper published in November 2019 on Arxiv.
Currently, the ambition of the series is to follow this plan:
 A high level introduction to Compressive Memory mechanics starting from basic RNNS;
 a detailed explanation of the algorithm and its tricky details;
 a walk-through of an implementation made in Sonnet (Deepmind’s high level framework on top of Tensorflow);</description>

      <description>|  | DRAFT 1  | This post is first and foremost asking for assistance. Is anything blatantly incorrect? If not, can anybody point to existing articles/posts/litterature?
We all have laptops. But le’ts face it, even in times of 32GB of RAM and NVMe2 drives, forget about running any interesting TensorFlow model. You need to get an external GPU, build your own rig, or very quickly pay a small fortune for cloud instances.</description>
